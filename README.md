# Android Playground

A mobile-first, plugin-based game engine designed for development entirely on Android devices using Termux. Built by AI agents for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a development environment for AI agents to build and test game engine designs. It features a multi-backend rendering system, hot-reload capabilities, and battery-efficient architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Termux](https://termux.com/) for terminal environment on Android
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) for building the engine and plugins
- Web browser for the development IDE

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tikaszar/android-playground.git
cd android-playground

# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Build with WebGL renderer (for browser IDE)
cargo build -p playground-rendering --features webgl

# Run the development server
cargo run -p playground-server
```

## Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic loading of game modules with hot-reload support
- **Rendering System**: Multi-backend renderer (WebGL implemented, Vulkan planned)
- **Type System**: Shared types ensuring plugin compatibility
- **Server**: Axum-based web server for browser IDE

## Current Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**
- Core type system and plugin infrastructure
- BaseRenderer trait with full rendering API
- WebGL2 renderer implementation
- Resource management with handle recycling
- Render graph system with passes
- State caching and batching
- Shader compilation and hot-reload
- Performance metrics and debugging
- **VSCode/Godot-style docking system** with drag & drop
- **Conversational-first UI system** with Element trait architecture
- **File tree component** with lazy loading and expand/collapse
- **Chat interface** with message bubbles and inline code
- **Code editor** with vim mode and multi-cursor support
- **Terminal integration** with Termux connection

ðŸš§ **In Progress**
- Mobile gesture support (touch, swipe, pinch)
- Text rendering system with SDF fonts
- WebSocket connection for terminal
- Plugin hot-reload mechanism

ðŸ“‹ **Planned**
- Vulkan renderer for compute shaders
