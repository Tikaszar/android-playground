# Android Playground

A mobile-first, plugin-based game engine designed for development entirely on Android devices using Termux. Built by AI agents for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a development environment for AI agents to build and test game engine designs. It features a multi-backend rendering system, hot-reload capabilities, and battery-efficient architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Termux](https://termux.com/) for terminal environment on Android
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) for building the engine and plugins
- Web browser for the development IDE

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Tikaszar/android-playground.git
cd android-playground

# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Build with WebGL renderer (for browser IDE)
cargo build -p playground-rendering --features webgl

# Run the development server
cargo run -p playground-server
```

## Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic loading of game modules with hot-reload support
- **Rendering System**: Multi-backend renderer (WebGL implemented, Vulkan planned)
- **Type System**: Shared types ensuring plugin compatibility
- **Server**: Axum-based web server for browser IDE
