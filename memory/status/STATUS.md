# Status - Current Implementation Status

## Build Status
- **Last known**: ⚠️ Partial Build
- **Issue**: systems/webgl and systems/ui don't compile
- **Working**: ALL core/* packages, systems/ecs, systems/console, systems/networking ✅
- **Note**: Session 63 - systems/networking fully rewritten for ECS and compiles

## Package Implementation Status

### Core Layer ✅ COMPLETE
All core packages follow data vs logic separation:

| Package | Status | VTable | Data Only | Features |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| core/types | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| core/ecs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | None (all required) |
| core/console | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | output, logging, input, etc |
| core/server | ✅ | N/A | ✅ ECS | websocket, channels, batching, etc |
| core/client | ✅ | N/A | ✅ ECS | rendering, input, audio, etc |
| core/rendering | ✅ | N/A | ✅ ECS | core-2d, core-3d, targets, etc |
| core/ui | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |

### Systems Layer ⚠️ PARTIAL

| Package | Status | VTable Handlers | Issues |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| systems/ecs | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| systems/console | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| systems/networking | ✅ | ✅ | ECS rewrite complete (Session 63) |
| systems/webgl | 🔴 | ❌ | DOESN'T COMPILE - Missing imports, trait errors |
| systems/ui | 🔴 | ❌ | DOESN'T COMPILE - Syntax errors, trait mismatches |
| ~~systems/logic~~ | ✅ | N/A | REMOVED in Session 59 |
| systems/physics | ❌ | ❌ | Needs complete rewrite |
| systems/android | ❓ | ❓ | Moved from core, status unknown |

### Apps Layer 🔴 BROKEN

| Package | Status | Uses Core Only | Issues |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------|
| playground-editor | 🔴 | ❌ | Broken - was using systems/logic |
| idle-mmo-rpg | N/A | N/A | NOT IN DEVELOPMENT - placeholder only |

### Plugins Layer ❌ BROKEN

All 9 IDE plugins are BROKEN (dependencies removed but code unchanged):

| Plugin | Status | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|
| chat-assistant | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| debugger | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| editor-core | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| file-browser | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| lsp-client | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| terminal | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| theme-manager | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| ui-framework | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| version-control | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |

## Feature Implementation

### Working Features ✅
- VTable dispatch mechanism
- Data vs logic separation
- Global instance management
- Feature flag system
- Async/await throughout
- Terminal dashboard
- WebSocket server basics

### Partially Working 🟡
- systems/networking server operations
- Channel management
- Message batching
- MCP integration

### Not Working ❌
- Client WebSocket connections
- Rendering pipeline
- UI system
- Plugin functionality
- Game features
- Physics
- Audio

## Current Blockers

### Critical Blockers 🔴
1. **systems/webgl doesn't compile** - Missing imports, trait errors
2. **systems/ui doesn't compile** - Severe syntax and trait errors
3. **systems/logic deprecated** - Needs removal

### Major Blockers 🟠
1. **systems/webgl needs VTable** - No rendering
2. **Plugins use wrong deps** - Need complete rewrite

### Minor Blockers 🟡
1. **Error handling inconsistent** - Some operations silent fail
2. **Documentation outdated** - Several files need updates

## Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| core/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| systems/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| apps/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| plugins/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |

## Performance Metrics

### Compilation
- Full rebuild: FAILS (systems/webgl, systems/ui errors)
- Incremental: FAILS (same errors)
- Target: < 30 seconds mobile

### Memory Usage
- Base engine: Unknown
- With plugins: Unknown
- Target: < 100MB

### Runtime
- FPS: Unknown
- Frame time: Unknown
- Target: 60fps, < 2ms

## Documentation Status

| File | Status | Needs Update |
|------|--------|--------------|
| README.md | 🟡 | Architecture changes |
| DESIGN_DECISIONS.md | 🟡 | Current architecture |
| DESIGN_CLARIFICATION.md | ✅ | Current |
| ROADMAP.md | 🟡 | Old format |
| HISTORY.md | 🟡 | Needs condensing |
| CONTEXT.md | ✅ | Current session |
| CLAUDE.md | 🟡 | Needs memory/* refs |
