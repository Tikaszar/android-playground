### Core Layer (MVVM Pattern)

| Package | Model | View | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| core/types | ✅ | N/A | ThreadSafe primitives (Handle, Shared, Atomic, Once) |
| core/ecs | ✅ | ✅ | Model+View complete; Integrated with version system (Session 82) |
| core/console | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Needs MVVM conversion |
| core/server | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Needs MVVM conversion |
| core/client | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Needs MVVM conversion |
| core/rendering | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Needs MVVM conversion |
| core/ui | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Needs MVVM conversion |

### Systems Layer (ViewModel Implementations)

|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| systems/ecs | ⚠️ | Needs Trait Impl | Has old serialization code, needs trait implementations |
| systems/console | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| systems/networking | ✅ | ✅ | ECS rewrite complete (Session 63) |
| systems/webgl | 🔴 | ❌ | DOESN'T COMPILE - Missing imports, trait errors |

| ~~systems/logic~~ | ✅ | N/A | REMOVED in Session 59 |
| systems/physics | ❌ | ❌ | Needs complete rewrite |
| systems/android | ❓ | ❓ | Moved from core, status unknown |

### Apps Layer 🔴 BROKEN

| idle-mmo-rpg | N/A | N/A | NOT IN DEVELOPMENT - placeholder only |

### Plugins Layer ❌ BROKEN

All 9 IDE plugins are BROKEN (dependencies removed but code unchanged):

| Plugin | Status | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|
| chat-assistant | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| debugger | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |
| editor-core | 🔴 | Code still imports removed systems |

## Feature Implementation

### Working Features ✅
- Automated version generation system (Session 82)
- API_VERSION generation from view+model hash
- STATE_FORMAT_VERSION generation from model hash
- Fragment-based MVVM infrastructure (Session 80)
- Trait-based MVVM (ModelTrait, ViewTrait, ViewModelTrait)
- Concurrent, flattened binding map with non-blocking updates
- Lock-free View/ViewModel access
- Object recycling for Models
- THE single unsafe block (module loader)
- ThreadSafe primitives (Handle, Shared, Atomic, Once)
- Module metadata and lifecycle
- Hot-reload infrastructure
- Async/await throughout
- Feature flag system

### Partially Working 🟡
- ECS Model layer (data structures complete)
- ECS View layer (stubs exist, need trait conversion)
- ECS ViewModel layer (implementations exist, need trait conversion)
- systems/networking server operations
- Channel management
- Message batching
- MCP integration

### Not Working ❌
- Module loading (Stateless loading infrastructure is ready, but stateful hot-reload requires implementation of the optional `save_state`/`restore_state` methods on `ViewModelTrait`)
- Direct trait method calls (needs trait implementations in modules)
- Client WebSocket connections
- Rendering pipeline
- UI system
- Plugin functionality
- Game features
- Physics
- Audio

## Current Blockers

### Critical Blockers 🔴
1. **core/ecs module_exports.rs obsolete** - References deleted ViewAPI type
2. **systems/ecs module_exports.rs obsolete** - References deleted types
3. **core/ecs View layer** - Needs conversion to trait definitions
4. **systems/ecs ViewModel layer** - Needs conversion to trait implementations

### Major Blockers 🟠
1. **systems/webgl doesn't compile** - Missing imports, trait errors
2. **systems/ui doesn't compile** - Severe syntax and trait errors
3. **Plugins use wrong deps** - Need complete rewrite

### Minor Blockers 🟡
1. **Error handling inconsistent** - Some operations silent fail
2. **Documentation outdated** - Several files need updates

## Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| core/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| systems/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| modules/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| apps/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |
| plugins/* | ❌ | ❌ | No tests |

## Performance Metrics (Session 79)

### Module System Performance
- View/ViewModel lookup: ~5ns (lock-free)
- Model pool lookup: ~5ns (lock-free, single lookup)
- Model access: ~20-30ns (per-pool RwLock)
- Object recycling: Reduces allocations

### Expected Component Performance (Design, Not Yet Implemented)
- Component access: 2-5ns (with native pools)
- Lock contention: Per-pool (vs global)
- Memory: 50% reduction (no serialization)

### Compilation
- modules/* packages: ✅ All compile successfully
- core/ecs: ⚠️ Compiles but has obsolete exports
- systems/ecs: ⚠️ Compiles but has obsolete exports
- Full rebuild: NEEDS TESTING after trait conversion
- Target: < 30 seconds mobile

### Memory Usage
- Base engine: Unknown
- With plugins: Unknown
- Target: < 100MB

### Runtime
- FPS: Unknown
- Frame time: Unknown
- Target: 60fps, < 2ms
