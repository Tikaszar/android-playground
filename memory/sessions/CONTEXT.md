# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 62 Complete ✅
Core/server and core/client ECS rewrite:
1. ✅ Removed all singleton patterns
2. ✅ Created proper ECS components
3. ✅ API functions use Entity/EntityRef
4. ✅ No implementation logic in core
5. ✅ All packages compile successfully

## Key Accomplishments
- Complete ECS transformation of core/server and core/client
- Everything is a component (connections, channels, clients, render targets)
- Proper architecture compliance - data only in core
- Feature gating throughout for optional capabilities
- Type aliases (Float, Int, UInt) used consistently

## Pattern Established
```rust
// All core packages now follow this pattern:
// 1. Define components with data only
pub struct SomeComponent {
    pub data: DataType,
}
impl_component_data!(SomeComponent);

// 2. API functions create entities
pub async fn create_thing() -> CoreResult<Entity> {
    let entity = world.spawn_entity().await?;
    entity.add_component(SomeComponent::new()).await?;
    Ok(entity)
}

// 3. Systems implement logic via VTable
```

## Next Session Tasks
1. Fix systems/webgl to query ECS for rendering
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Update systems/networking for new core/server
4. Begin plugin rewrites to use core/*

## Important Context
- Build status: core/* ✅ ALL COMPILE
- systems/webgl: ❌ BROKEN (needs ECS queries)
- systems/ui: ❌ BROKEN (needs rewrite)
- systems/networking: ⚠️ Needs update for new core/server
- plugins/*: ❌ BROKEN (need complete rewrites)

## Outstanding Issues
- systems/webgl needs to query ECS for components
- systems/ui needs complete rewrite
- systems/networking needs to use new core/server API
- All 9 plugins need rewriting to use core/*

## Notes for Next Session
With core/server and core/client now properly using ECS, the systems layer needs updating to work with the new component-based architecture. Focus should be on systems/webgl first as it's needed for rendering.
