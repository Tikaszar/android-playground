# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 58 Completed ✅
Fixed systems/networking unsafe violations:
1. ✅ Removed all unsafe usage using Lazy<NetworkState>
2. ✅ Removed non-networking operations (render/audio/input)
3. ⏸️ Client operations still stubbed (future work)

## Key Accomplishments
- Replaced `static mut` with `once_cell::sync::Lazy`
- Used Handle<T> and Shared<T> type aliases consistently
- Removed operations that belong in other systems
- Project builds successfully

## Pattern Established
```rust
static NETWORK_STATE: Lazy<NetworkState> = Lazy::new(|| NetworkState {
    server: shared(None),
    client_connections: shared(HashMap::new()),
});
```

## Next Session Tasks
1. Implement client WebSocket operations properly
2. Fix systems/webgl VTable handlers for rendering
3. Continue plugin architecture fixes
4. Update documentation

## Important Context
- Build status: ✅ SUCCESS
- NO unsafe rule: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Architecture compliance improving
- Client implementation deferred but architecture correct

## Outstanding Issues
- Plugins still bypass core architecture (Critical)
- systems/webgl needs VTable handlers (Major)
- systems/ui needs complete rewrite (Major)
- Client operations need implementation (Minor)

## Notes for Next Session
The unsafe violations are completely resolved. Focus should shift to implementing systems/webgl VTable handlers for rendering operations that were removed from systems/networking.
