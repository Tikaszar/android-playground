# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 64 Complete ✅
Core/rendering ECS rewrite:
1. ✅ Deleted renderer.rs and operations.rs (violations)
2. ✅ Created proper component organization (mandatory vs optional)
3. ✅ Rewrote API to use entities instead of singleton
4. ✅ Implemented feature-based component system
5. ✅ Core/rendering now compiles successfully

## Key Accomplishments
- Complete ECS transformation of core/rendering
- Removed all singleton patterns and separate VTable
- Feature-based component organization (mandatory vs optional)
- All API functions work with entities
- Proper directory structure for feature components

## Pattern Established
```rust
// Systems layer pattern for ECS integration:
// 1. Store Entity references in state
pub struct NetworkState {
    pub server_entity: Shared<Option<Entity>>,
    pub server_impl: Shared<Option<Handle<NetworkServer>>>, // Internal
}

// 2. Use core API to create entities
let entity = server_api::start_server(config).await?;

// 3. Manage implementation internally
let server_impl = handle(NetworkServer { /* actual network */ });

// 4. Bridge ECS components with implementation
```

## Next Session Tasks
1. Fix systems/webgl to query ECS for rendering
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Update systems/physics for ECS
4. Begin plugin rewrites to use core/*

## Important Context
- Build status: core/* ✅, systems/networking ✅, systems/ecs ✅, systems/console ✅
- systems/webgl: ❌ BROKEN (needs ECS queries)
- systems/ui: ❌ BROKEN (needs complete rewrite)
- plugins/*: ❌ BROKEN (need complete rewrites)

## Outstanding Issues
- systems/webgl needs to query ECS for components
- systems/ui needs complete rewrite
- All 9 plugins need rewriting to use core/*
- Systems/physics needs implementation

## Notes for Next Session
With systems/networking now properly using ECS, focus should shift to systems/webgl as it's needed for rendering. The pattern established in networking (Entity references + internal implementation) should be applied.
