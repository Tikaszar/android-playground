# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 69 Complete ✅
core/ecs MVVM rewrite complete:
1. ✅ Model layer - Pure data structures
2. ✅ View layer - API contracts only
3. ✅ Event System - Pre/Post events replacing Messaging
4. ✅ Module exports - PLAYGROUND_MODULE and PLAYGROUND_VIEW_API
5. ✅ Compiles as dylib

## Current State
- core/ecs fully implemented with MVVM
- Event System with Pub-Sub model
- Direct function binding ready (~1-5ns)
- No VTable, no serialization overhead

## Next Session (70) Tasks
1. **Create systems/ecs ViewModel** - Implement View contracts
2. **Bind View to ViewModel** - Test module binding
3. **Verify hot-reload** - Test state preservation
4. **Update other core modules** - Apply MVVM pattern

## Important Notes
- Event System > Messaging
- Pre-events are cancellable
- Post-events are notifications
- Priority-based event handling
- Direct function pointers, not VTable
