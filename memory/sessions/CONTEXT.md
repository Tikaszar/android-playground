# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 67 Complete ✅
MVVM architecture fully designed to replace VTable:
1. ✅ Core modules = Model + View (data + API)
2. ✅ System modules = ViewModel (implementation)
3. ✅ App-driven loading via Cargo.toml
4. ✅ Compile-time feature validation
5. ✅ No runtime indirection

## Key Architecture Change
**FROM**: VTable with serialization overhead (~1000ns)
**TO**: MVVM with direct binding (~1-5ns)

Apps declare in Cargo.toml:
- Which Core modules they need
- Which Systems implement them
- What features are required

## Current State
- Uncommitted changes from Session 66 need reverting
- api/ should become modules/
- systems/module-loader wrong location
- Need clean slate for MVVM implementation

## Next Session (68) Tasks
1. **Revert all uncommitted changes** - Start fresh
2. **Create modules/types** - MVVM base types
3. **Create modules/loader** - Single unsafe
4. **Create modules/binding** - View-ViewModel connection
5. **Test with core/ecs** - First module conversion

## Important Notes
- NO VTable anywhere
- Compile-time errors only
- Apps never import Systems
- Plugins never import Systems
- Direct function calls after binding
