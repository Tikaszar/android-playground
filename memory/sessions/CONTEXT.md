# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 60 In Progress üîÑ
Complete rewrite of core/rendering:
1. ‚úÖ Created proper ECS-based architecture
2. ‚úÖ All resources are components
3. ‚úÖ Proper feature flags throughout
4. ‚úÖ Type aliases (Float, Int, UInt)
5. ‚úÖ Fixed all compilation errors

## Key Accomplishments
- Completely rewrote core/rendering with proper architecture
- Everything is a component (including resources)
- No immediate mode - all batched and async
- Proper subdirectory structure (2d/, 3d/, shared/)
- One component per file
- All feature-gated appropriately

## Pattern Established
```rust
// Resources as components
let texture = world.create_entity();
world.add_component(texture, Texture { ... });

// Reference resources via EntityId
let sprite = world.create_entity();
world.add_component(sprite, Sprite {
    texture: Some(texture),  // EntityId reference
    ...
});
```

## Next Session Tasks
1. Fix systems/webgl to use new core/rendering
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Rewrite plugins to use core/* with features
4. Implement batching in systems/webgl

## Important Context
- Build status: core/rendering ‚úÖ COMPILES
- systems/webgl: ‚ùå BROKEN (needs update)
- systems/ui: ‚ùå BROKEN (needs rewrite)
- plugins/*: ‚ùå BROKEN (need complete rewrites)
- Architecture compliance: IMPROVING

## Outstanding Issues
- systems/webgl needs to query ECS for rendering
- systems/ui needs complete rewrite
- All 9 plugins need rewriting to use core/*
- Need to implement proper batching

## Notes for Next Session
core/rendering is now complete and follows proper architecture. Focus should shift to updating systems/webgl to use the new component-based rendering system.
