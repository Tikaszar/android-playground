# Context - Session Continuity

## Session 63 Complete ✅
Systems/networking ECS rewrite:
1. ✅ Created state management for Entity references
2. ✅ Rewrote vtable_handlers for ECS entities
3. ✅ Updated registration for VTable system
4. ✅ All compilation errors fixed
5. ✅ Systems/networking now compiles successfully

## Key Accomplishments
- Complete ECS transformation of systems/networking
- Proper separation of ECS entities from network implementation
- Entity-based state management replaces singletons
- VTable registration through world.vtable
- Component access follows get/remove/add pattern

## Pattern Established
```rust
// Systems layer pattern for ECS integration:
// 1. Store Entity references in state
pub struct NetworkState {
    pub server_entity: Shared<Option<Entity>>,
    pub server_impl: Shared<Option<Handle<NetworkServer>>>, // Internal
}

// 2. Use core API to create entities
let entity = server_api::start_server(config).await?;

// 3. Manage implementation internally
let server_impl = handle(NetworkServer { /* actual network */ });

// 4. Bridge ECS components with implementation
```

## Next Session Tasks
1. Fix systems/webgl to query ECS for rendering
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Update systems/physics for ECS
4. Begin plugin rewrites to use core/*

## Important Context
- Build status: core/* ✅, systems/networking ✅, systems/ecs ✅, systems/console ✅
- systems/webgl: ❌ BROKEN (needs ECS queries)
- systems/ui: ❌ BROKEN (needs complete rewrite)
- plugins/*: ❌ BROKEN (need complete rewrites)

## Outstanding Issues
- systems/webgl needs to query ECS for components
- systems/ui needs complete rewrite
- All 9 plugins need rewriting to use core/*
- Systems/physics needs implementation

## Notes for Next Session
With systems/networking now properly using ECS, focus should shift to systems/webgl as it's needed for rendering. The pattern established in networking (Entity references + internal implementation) should be applied.
