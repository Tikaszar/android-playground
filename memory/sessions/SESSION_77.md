# Session 77 - Performance Implementation & ViewModel Completion

## Session Goal
Implement the performance-critical ECS improvements designed in Session 76 and complete the remaining ViewModel stubs.

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. ThreadSafe Primitive Wrappers ✅
- Implemented `Atomic<T>` wrapper for primitive types (u8, u16, u32, u64, usize, i8, i16, i32, i64, isize, bool, f32, f64)
- Implemented `Once<T>` wrapper for one-time initialization
- Fixed Atomic to use primitive types directly (`Atomic<u64>` not `Atomic<AtomicU64>`)
- No unsafe code - uses enum internally to map types

### 2. World Model Updates ✅
- Updated all ID counters from `AtomicU32` to `Atomic<u64>` (64-bit)
- Replaced component storage with component registry
- Changed from `components: Shared<HashMap<EntityId, HashMap<ComponentId, Component>>>`
- To `component_registry: Shared<HashMap<ComponentId, SystemId>>`
- World now only tracks which system owns which component type

### 3. System Model Updates ✅
- Added `component_pools: Shared<HashMap<ComponentId, ComponentPoolHandle>>` to System
- Systems now own their component data for optimal cache locality
- Created `ComponentPoolHandle` as opaque type-erased handle

### 4. Component Refactoring ✅
- Removed `Bytes` serialization from Component struct
- Component is now just metadata (ID, name, size_hint)
- Created `ComponentPool<T>` for native type storage
- Pools store `HashMap<EntityId, T>` directly - no serialization

### 5. Architecture Benefits
- **No serialization overhead** - Components stored as native types
- **System-owned storage** - Better cache locality and parallelism
- **Type-safe pools** - `ComponentPool<T>` provides compile-time safety
- **Flexible threading** - Components decide their own concurrency strategy
- **Event-based communication** - Systems communicate through World events

## Next Steps
- Complete remaining ViewModel stubs in query/storage/system/world modules
- Add save_state/load_state for hot-reload testing
- Create build.rs validation for module dependencies
- Upgrade ComponentId to 64-bit deterministic hashing

## Key Decisions
- NO example components in core - components are domain-specific
- Systems own their pools, World is just a registry
- Component threading is decided by the component itself, not the pool
- All operations maintain MVVM separation

## Compilation Status
- ✅ playground-core-types compiles
- ✅ playground-core-ecs compiles (clean, no warnings)
- ⏳ playground-systems-ecs has stub warnings (expected)
