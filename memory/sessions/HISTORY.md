# History - Session Index

## Session Ranges and Major Accomplishments

### Session 65: Hot-Loadable Module Architecture Design
- Designed complete hot-loadable module system to replace VTable
- All layers (Core, Systems, Plugins, Apps) become hot-loadable
- Feature-based dependencies with semantic versioning
- 1000x performance improvement over VTable (direct calls vs serialization)
- Created comprehensive documentation and implementation roadmap

### Session 67: MVVM Architecture Design
- Replaced VTable with MVVM pattern (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Core modules provide Model (data) + View (API contracts)
- System modules provide ViewModel (implementation only)
- App-driven module loading via Cargo.toml declarations
- Compile-time feature validation in build.rs
- Direct function calls with ~1-5ns overhead (no serialization)

### Session 68: MVVM Implementation - modules/* Infrastructure
- Implemented complete modules/* infrastructure
- Created MVVM base types with NO traits (concrete classes only)
- Single unsafe block in modules/loader for ALL operations
- Proper Rust module organization (subdirectories with mod.rs)
- One struct per file throughout
- Direct function pointer binding for minimal overhead

### Session 66: Pure Rust Hot-Loading Implementation
- Finalized pure Rust hot-loading design (no C ABI)
- Single unsafe exception for Library::new() documented
- Module interface uses pure Rust function pointers
- Support for all module types with state preservation
- Console commands for runtime module management

### Session 64: Core/rendering ECS rewrite
- Complete rewrite of core/rendering for ECS compliance
- Removed singleton pattern and separate VTable
- Created feature-based component organization
- Mandatory components always available, optional feature-gated
- Core/rendering now compiles successfully

### Session 63: Systems/networking ECS rewrite
- Complete rewrite of systems/networking for ECS compatibility
- Created state management for Entity references
- Replaced singleton access with Entity handles
- VTable registration through world.vtable
- Systems/networking now compiles successfully

### Session 62: Core/server and core/client ECS rewrite
- Complete rewrite of core/server to use ECS components
- Complete rewrite of core/client to use ECS components
- Removed all singleton patterns
- Everything is now an entity with components
- Proper architecture compliance achieved

### Session 61: Entity/EntityRef handle system
- Implemented Entity (strong) and EntityRef (weak) handle types
- Added generation tracking for entity validity
- Updated core/ecs and core/rendering to use safe references
- Prevented dangling entity references

### Session 60: Core/rendering complete rewrite
- Rewrote core/rendering with proper ECS integration
- All rendering data as components
- Proper feature flags throughout
- Type aliases used consistently

### Session 59: Remove deprecated systems
- Removed systems/logic completely (was deprecated)
- Removed system dependencies from all plugins
- Documented that plugins/webgl/ui don't compile
- Clarified idle-mmo-rpg is NOT in development

### Session 58: Fix unsafe violations
- Removed all unsafe code from systems/networking
- Established Lazy<NetworkState> pattern for global state
- Used Handle<T> and Shared<T> consistently
- Removed non-networking operations from networking system

### Sessions 52-57: Data vs Logic Architecture
- Designed new architecture with VTable dispatch
- Implemented abstract base class pattern
- Separated data (core) from logic (systems)
- Completed core/ecs, core/console, core/server, core/client

### Sessions 45-51: Core Layer Compliance
- Fixed all dyn/Any violations in core
- Moved platform code to systems
- Established Handle/Shared patterns
- Achieved zero violations in core layer

### Sessions 40-44: Unified ECS Implementation
- Created single unified World in systems/ecs
- Removed dual-ECS confusion
- Integrated messaging as core functionality
- Established staged execution pipeline

### Sessions 35-39: Dashboard and Logging
- Implemented terminal dashboard
- Added component-specific logging
- Fixed endianness issues
- Unified dashboard in core/server

### Sessions 28-34: Dynamic Channel Architecture
- Designed fully dynamic channel system
- Only channel 0 hardcoded for discovery
- Fixed plugin lifecycle management
- Established three-phase startup

### Sessions 24-27: Plugin Architecture
- Removed core/plugin package
- Plugins ARE Systems
- Fixed all IDE plugin implementations
- Apps coordinate plugins

### Sessions 20-23: NO dyn Refactoring
- Removed all trait objects
- Implemented Component/ComponentData pattern
- Fixed async propagation
- Established concrete wrapper patterns

### Sessions 14-19: Architecture Establishment
- Created 4-layer architecture
- Established strict rules (NO unsafe, NO dyn, NO Any)
- Fixed concurrency patterns
- Migrated to tokio::sync::RwLock

### Sessions 9-13: WebGL and UI Implementation
- Implemented WebGL renderer
- Created UI system
- Fixed deadlock issues
- Server-controlled renderer initialization

### Sessions 4-8: Core Infrastructure
- WebSocket implementation
- ECS foundation
- Binary protocol design
- Frame-based batching

### Sessions 1-3: Project Bootstrap
- Initial structure creation
- Basic compilation fixes
- Package standardization
- Build system setup

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Session 52: Feature-gated core packages
Apps/Plugins use ONLY core/* with compile-time features

### Session 43: Unified ECS
Single World for entire engine, not dual-layer

### Session 33: Three-phase startup
Register → Initialize Core → Initialize Plugins

### Session 26: Plugins ARE Systems
No separate Plugin trait, implement System

### Session 17: NO dyn compliance
Concrete base class pattern for type erasure
