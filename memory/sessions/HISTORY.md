# History - Session Index

## Session Ranges and Major Accomplishments

### Session 59: Remove deprecated systems (IN PROGRESS)
- Removed systems/logic completely (was deprecated)
- Removed system dependencies from all plugins
- Documented that plugins/webgl/ui don't compile
- Clarified idle-mmo-rpg is NOT in development

### Session 58: Fix unsafe violations
- Removed all unsafe code from systems/networking
- Established Lazy<NetworkState> pattern for global state
- Used Handle<T> and Shared<T> consistently
- Removed non-networking operations from networking system

### Sessions 52-57: Data vs Logic Architecture
- Designed new architecture with VTable dispatch
- Implemented abstract base class pattern
- Separated data (core) from logic (systems)
- Completed core/ecs, core/console, core/server, core/client

### Sessions 45-51: Core Layer Compliance
- Fixed all dyn/Any violations in core
- Moved platform code to systems
- Established Handle/Shared patterns
- Achieved zero violations in core layer

### Sessions 40-44: Unified ECS Implementation
- Created single unified World in systems/ecs
- Removed dual-ECS confusion
- Integrated messaging as core functionality
- Established staged execution pipeline

### Sessions 35-39: Dashboard and Logging
- Implemented terminal dashboard
- Added component-specific logging
- Fixed endianness issues
- Unified dashboard in core/server

### Sessions 28-34: Dynamic Channel Architecture
- Designed fully dynamic channel system
- Only channel 0 hardcoded for discovery
- Fixed plugin lifecycle management
- Established three-phase startup

### Sessions 24-27: Plugin Architecture
- Removed core/plugin package
- Plugins ARE Systems
- Fixed all IDE plugin implementations
- Apps coordinate plugins

### Sessions 20-23: NO dyn Refactoring
- Removed all trait objects
- Implemented Component/ComponentData pattern
- Fixed async propagation
- Established concrete wrapper patterns

### Sessions 14-19: Architecture Establishment
- Created 4-layer architecture
- Established strict rules (NO unsafe, NO dyn, NO Any)
- Fixed concurrency patterns
- Migrated to tokio::sync::RwLock

### Sessions 9-13: WebGL and UI Implementation
- Implemented WebGL renderer
- Created UI system
- Fixed deadlock issues
- Server-controlled renderer initialization

### Sessions 4-8: Core Infrastructure
- WebSocket implementation
- ECS foundation
- Binary protocol design
- Frame-based batching

### Sessions 1-3: Project Bootstrap
- Initial structure creation
- Basic compilation fixes
- Package standardization
- Build system setup

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Session 52: Feature-gated core packages
Apps/Plugins use ONLY core/* with compile-time features

### Session 43: Unified ECS
Single World for entire engine, not dual-layer

### Session 33: Three-phase startup
Register → Initialize Core → Initialize Plugins

### Session 26: Plugins ARE Systems
No separate Plugin trait, implement System

### Session 17: NO dyn compliance
Concrete base class pattern for type erasure

## Build Status Tracking
- Sessions 1-57: Various build states during architecture changes
- Session 58: systems/networking builds but webgl/ui don't
- Session 59: Confirmed webgl/ui/plugins all broken, need rewrites
- Session 60: core/rendering rewrite complete, compiles successfully
- Session 61: Entity/EntityRef system implemented, core/ecs and systems/ecs compile
