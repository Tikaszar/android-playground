# Current Session - Session 80: Fragment-Based MVVM Infrastructure with Runtime Types

## Session Goal
Add fragment support to MVVM traits for logical grouping of View/ViewModel methods and implement runtime type generation for Models.

## Context from Session 79
Session 79 completed the modules/* infrastructure with:
- Trait-based MVVM (ModelTrait, ViewTrait, ViewModelTrait)
- Triple-nested sharding (ViewId → ModelType → ModelPool)
- Lock-free Views/ViewModels access
- Object recycling in pools
- THE single unsafe block in loader
- All modules/* packages compile ✅

## Work Completed ✅

### 1. Runtime Type Generation
- ✅ Created `model_type_of<T>()` function using TypeId hashing
- ✅ All ECS models now implement ModelTrait with runtime types
- ✅ No hardcoded constants, no risk of overlaps
- ✅ Compile-time type safety maintained

### 2. Associated Types Pattern Implementation
- ✅ DELETED ViewFragmentTrait and ViewModelFragmentTrait (not needed with associated types)
- ✅ Updated EcsViewTrait to use Associated Types pattern
- ✅ Created fragment structs (EntityFragment, ComponentFragment, etc.)
- ✅ Moved all implementations from view.rs files to fragment.rs files
- ✅ Updated EcsView to compose fragments via associated types
- ✅ Deleted all old view.rs files from fragments
- ✅ Updated all mod.rs files to export fragments

### 2. Fragment Pattern Changes
- ✅ Each fragment is now its own struct (EntityFragment, ComponentFragment, etc.)
- ✅ EcsView composes all fragments via fields
- ✅ Associated types provide compile-time safety
- ✅ Preserved ALL existing functionality in EventView and WorldView traits

## Work Remaining

### 1. Fix Remaining Compilation Issues
- Fix WorldView trait to include missing methods (save_world_state, load_world_state, etc.)
- Ensure all fragments compile correctly

### 2. Convert systems/ecs to Fragment Implementations
- Create fragment structs for ViewModel implementations
- Update EcsViewModel to use associated types pattern
- Delete obsolete module_exports.rs

### 3. Test Full System
- Verify core/ecs compiles completely
- Verify systems/ecs compiles
- Test module loading

### 4. Plan for Session 81
- **Implement `BindingRegistry` Refactor**: Change `modules/binding` to use the flattened, concurrent map with `arc-swap`.
- **Implement Build System**: Create the central `modules/build-utils` crate and add the boilerplate `build.rs` hooks and `Cargo.toml` metadata to all `Core` and `System` modules to generate the automated version constants.
- **Implement Stateful Hot-Reload**: Update `ViewModelTrait` with optional state methods. Update the loader and registry to perform the version checks and orchestrate the save/restore process.

## Key Design Decisions

### Fragment Pattern
Fragments are **source code organization** not runtime organization:
- One View/ViewModel trait object at runtime (still single symbol export)
- Multiple fragment traits in source code for logical grouping
- Composite trait (EcsViewTrait) enforces all fragments at compile time

### Compile-Time Enforcement
```rust
pub trait EcsViewTrait:
    ViewTrait +
    EntityView +
    ComponentView +
    // ... all fragments
{}

impl EcsViewTrait for EcsViewModel {}  // Won't compile if missing any fragment
```

### Feature Gates (Future)
```rust
pub trait RenderingViewTrait:
    ViewTrait +
    WindowView +
    #[cfg(feature = "shaders")]
    + ShaderView
{}
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ modules/types has fragment support
- ⏳ core/ecs uses fragment traits
- ⏳ systems/ecs implements fragments
- ⏳ Compile-time enforcement works
- ⏳ All packages compile
