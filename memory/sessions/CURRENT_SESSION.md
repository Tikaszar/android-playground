# Current Session - Active Work

## Session 58: COMPLETE ✅

### Session Goal
Organize memory system and fix systems/networking violations

### Work Completed This Session

#### 1. Memory System Reorganization
Created new memory/* structure with subdirectories:
- `memory/architecture/` - Architecture patterns and code examples
  - ARCHITECTURE.md - Complete architecture documentation
  - PATTERNS.md - Code patterns and anti-patterns
- `memory/design/` - Long-term vision and roadmap
  - DESIGN.md - Vision, goals, target architecture
  - ROADMAP.md - Task sequence and milestones
- `memory/status/` - Current state tracking
  - STATUS.md - Implementation status by package
  - VIOLATIONS.md - Current violations and fixes needed
- `memory/sessions/` - Session tracking
  - CURRENT_SESSION.md - This file
  - HISTORY.md - Session index
  - CONTEXT.md - Session continuity

#### 2. Analysis of systems/networking Issues

**Identified Problems**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Uses `unsafe` with `static mut` - violates NO unsafe rule
2. **HIGH**: Client operations not implemented, just stubs
3. **MEDIUM**: Contains rendering/audio/input handlers that belong elsewhere
4. **LOW**: Some error handling is generic or silent

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Previous commit tried to follow VTable pattern but:
  - Used unsafe for global state (wrong pattern)
  - Didn't understand systems can only use core
  - Started implementing operations for other systems

**Correct Understanding Established**:
- Apps/Plugins use core/* ONLY (with features)
- Systems/* use core/* ONLY (implement the contracts)
- Core/* has data + VTable, NO logic
- Systems cannot know about other systems

#### 3. Fix Plan Developed

**For unsafe issue**:
- Use `OnceCell` pattern from systems/console
- Access Server/Client through core API functions
- Store only implementation-specific state

**For client implementation**:
- Use existing WebSocketHandler for client mode
- Implement actual connection logic
- Update core/client state properly

**For wrong operations**:
- Remove rendering/audio/input handlers entirely
- Those belong in systems/webgl, systems/audio, systems/input

#### 4. Fixed unsafe violations in systems/networking

**Changes made**:
1. Replaced `static mut` with `once_cell::sync::Lazy<NetworkState>`
2. Used `Shared<Option<Arc<NetworkServer>>>` for mutable server reference
3. Removed all `unsafe` blocks - now fully compliant with NO unsafe rule
4. Updated initialization to use `Lazy` pattern for automatic initialization

**Pattern used**:
```rust
static NETWORK_STATE: Lazy<NetworkState> = Lazy::new(|| NetworkState {
    server: shared(None),
    client_connections: shared(HashMap::new()),
});
```

#### 5. Removed non-networking operations

**Operations removed**:
- `handle_render_operations` - belongs in systems/webgl
- `handle_audio_operations` - belongs in systems/audio
- `handle_input_operations` - belongs in systems/input

**Registration updated**:
- Removed VTable registrations for render/audio/input
- Added comments indicating where these operations belong

#### 6. Build verification

**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- Project builds successfully
- Only minor warnings about unused fields remain
- All unsafe violations resolved

### Next Steps

1. Implement client operations properly (currently stubbed)
2. Fix systems/webgl to implement rendering VTable handlers
3. Update CLAUDE.md with memory/* references
4. Commit the changes

### Notes
- Architecture is clearer now with memory organization
- Used `Lazy` instead of `OnceCell` for simpler initialization
- Must maintain strict system isolation
- Client implementation still needs work but unsafe is fixed
