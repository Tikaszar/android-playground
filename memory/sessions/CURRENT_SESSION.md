# Current Session - Active Work

## Session 62: COMPLETED

### Session Goal
Complete rewrite of core/server and core/client to use ECS components instead of singleton pattern

### Work Completed This Session

#### 1. Core/server Complete Rewrite
- Removed singleton Server struct
- Created ECS components:
  - ServerConnection - Connection entities with metadata
  - ServerChannel - Channel entities for pub/sub
  - MessageQueue - Batching support component
  - ServerConfigComponent - Server configuration
  - ServerStatsComponent - Server statistics
  - ServerState - Server runtime state
- API functions return Entity handles
- All features properly gated
- Type aliases (Float, Int, UInt) used consistently

#### 2. Core/client Complete Rewrite
- Removed singleton Client struct
- Created ECS components:
  - ClientConfigComponent - Client configuration
  - ClientStateComponent - Client runtime state
  - ClientStatsComponent - Client statistics
  - InputStateComponent - Input handling (feature-gated)
  - RenderTargetComponent - Render targets (feature-gated)
  - AudioStateComponent - Audio state (feature-gated)
- API functions return Entity handles
- All features properly gated
- Type aliases used consistently

#### 3. Architecture Compliance
- Everything is an ECS component (no singletons)
- Uses impl_component_data! macro for all components
- API functions work with Entity/EntityRef handles
- No implementation logic in core (data only)
- No TODO comments (per rules)
- Proper feature gating throughout
- Connections, channels, render targets are all entities

### Architecture Pattern Established

```rust
// Core packages define components
pub struct ServerConnection {
    pub id: ConnectionId,
    pub status: ConnectionStatus,
    // ... data fields only
}
impl_component_data!(ServerConnection);

// API creates entities with components
pub async fn accept_connection(address: String) -> CoreResult<Entity> {
    let world = get_world().await?;
    let conn_entity = world.spawn_entity().await?;
    conn_entity.add_component(ServerConnection::new(ConnectionId::new())).await?;
    Ok(conn_entity)
}

// Systems implement the actual logic via VTable
```

### Files Changed
- core/server/src/lib.rs - Complete rewrite
- core/server/src/api.rs - ECS-based API
- core/server/src/types.rs - Added new() for IDs
- core/server/src/components/* - All new components
- Removed: server.rs, operations.rs (old singleton)

- core/client/src/lib.rs - Complete rewrite
- core/client/src/api.rs - ECS-based API
- core/client/src/types.rs - Added type aliases
- core/client/src/components/* - All new components
- Removed: client.rs, operations.rs (old singleton)

### Next Steps
1. Fix systems/webgl to use new core/rendering and core/client
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Update systems/networking to use new core/server
4. Rewrite all plugins to use core/* with features
