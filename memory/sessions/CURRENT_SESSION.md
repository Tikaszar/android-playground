## Session 66: Pure Rust Hot-Loading Implementation

### Session Goal
Implement pure Rust hot-loading system with single unsafe exception for Library::new(), supporting all module types (Core, Systems, Plugins, Apps) with runtime reload capability.

### Work Completed This Session

#### 1. Design Iterations
- Explored multiple approaches (WASM, separate processes, bytecode)
- Rejected all approaches that violated core rules
- Settled on libloading with single unsafe exception

#### 2. Pure Rust Module Interface
- Designed pure Rust interface (no C ABI, no extern "C")
- Module exports single static PLAYGROUND_MODULE
- VTable uses pure Rust function pointers
- All communication through serialization

#### 3. Single Unsafe Exception
- Documented exception in CLAUDE.md
- Only unsafe is Library::new() in module loader
- Everything else wrapped in safe abstractions
- Extensive validation before unsafe call

#### 4. Module System Architecture
- Support for all module types (Core, Systems, Plugins, Apps)
- Hot-reload preserves state across reloads
- Dependency tracking and validation
- Console commands for runtime management

#### 5. Documentation Updated
- Updated `memory/architecture/MODULES.md` - Pure Rust design
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` - Documented unsafe exception
- Clear migration path from VTable

### Key Decisions

1. **Single unsafe exception** - Only Library::new() allowed
2. **Pure Rust interfaces** - No C ABI or extern "C"
3. **Use libloading** - For dynamic library loading
4. **All module types hot-loadable** - Core, Systems, Plugins, Apps
5. **State preservation** - Via serialization
6. **Schema validation** - Before loading modules
7. **Console commands** - Runtime module management

### Architecture Highlights

```
systems/module-loader (with single unsafe)
    ↓ loads
api/ (pure Rust interfaces)
    ↓ implement
modules/
    ├── core/*     (data/contracts)
    ├── systems/*  (implementations)
    ├── plugins/*  (features)
    └── apps/*     (applications)

All hot-loadable at runtime!
```

### Next Steps (Session 67)
1. Create `api/` crate with pure Rust interfaces
2. Build `systems/module-loader` implementation
3. Remove VTable from core/ecs
4. Add module interface to first core package
5. Test hot-reload functionality
