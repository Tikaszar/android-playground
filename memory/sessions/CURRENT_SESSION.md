# Current Session - Active Work

## Session 60: IN PROGRESS

### Session Goal
Complete rewrite of core/rendering with proper ECS integration and feature flags

### Work Completed This Session

#### 1. Complete core/rendering rewrite
- Redesigned with proper ECS integration
- Everything is a component (resources too)
- No immediate mode - all batched, async, multithreaded
- Proper separation: rendering for graphics, UI goes in core/ui

#### 2. Created proper component structure
- Created subdirectories: `2d/`, `3d/`, `shared/`
- One component per file (NO BATCHING as requested)
- All properly feature-gated:
  - `core-2d` for 2D components
  - `core-3d` for 3D components
  - `textures`, `shaders`, `buffers` for resources
  - Many more granular features

#### 3. Type system improvements
- Added type aliases (Float, Int, UInt, etc.)
- Used consistently throughout
- No more hardcoded f32, u32, etc.

#### 4. Fixed all compilation errors
- Fixed EntityId imports (was using wrong Entity type)
- Created missing modules (operations.rs, api.rs)
- Fixed all component imports
- Result: âœ… Zero compilation errors

#### 5. Key architectural decisions
- Resources ARE components on entities
- Textures, Meshes, Materials - all components
- RenderCommand works with entities, not raw data
- Systems/webgl will query ECS for what to render
- Batching happens automatically by querying components

### Architecture Established

```rust
// Everything is ECS-based
let texture_entity = world.create_entity();
world.add_component(texture_entity, Texture { ... });

let sprite_entity = world.create_entity();
world.add_component(sprite_entity, Transform2D { ... });
world.add_component(sprite_entity, Sprite {
    texture: Some(texture_entity),  // Reference to texture entity!
    ...
});

// Systems query and batch automatically
let sprites = world.query::<(&Transform2D, &Sprite)>();
// Batch by texture for efficiency
```

### Next Steps

1. Fix systems/webgl to work with new core/rendering
2. Fix systems/ui compilation errors
3. Update plugins to use core/* with feature flags
4. Implement proper batching in systems/webgl

### Notes
- core/rendering is now purely data + VTable delegation
- All rendering logic will be in systems/webgl
- UI components will be in core/ui (separate package)
- Everything respects the NO unsafe, NO dyn rules
