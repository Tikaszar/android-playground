# Current Session - Session 69: core/ecs MVVM Rewrite

## Session Goal
Rewrite core/ecs with MVVM pattern and Event System.

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Complete core/ecs Rewrite ✅
- Removed old core/ecs implementation
- Created new MVVM structure:
  - Model: Pure data structures
  - View: API contracts only
  - Module exports: PLAYGROUND_MODULE and PLAYGROUND_VIEW_API

### 2. Event System Implementation ✅
- Replaced Messaging with Event System
- Pre-events (cancellable)
- Post-events (notifications)
- Priority-based subscriptions
- Common event IDs predefined

### 3. Fixed modules/types Issues ✅
- Changed ViewAPI to use static slice instead of Vec
- Added Copy/Clone to ModuleLifecycle
- Fixed all compilation errors

### 4. Architecture Compliance ✅
- NO unsafe code
- NO dyn/Any
- One struct per file
- lib.rs/mod.rs exports only
- Direct function binding ready

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Event System > Messaging**
2. **MVVM separation enforced**
3. **Compiles as dylib**
4. **~1-5ns overhead via direct binding**

## Next Session (70)

1. Create systems/ecs with ViewModel implementation
2. Implement all View functions
