# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-22 (Session 8)

### Current Status
**WebGL Rendering Working!** - Screen now shows grey background, MessageBus architecture complete

### What Was Done This Session (2025-08-22 - Session 8)
- **Fixed MessageBus Pipeline** ✅
  - UiSystem was publishing to its own internal ECS world, not shared MessageBus
  - Changed UiSystem to use NetworkingSystem.send_packet() which publishes to shared MessageBus
  - MessageBridge now successfully forwards messages from MessageBus to WebSocket clients
  - Browser receives RenderBatch packets on channel 10
  
- **Fixed Bincode Deserialization in Browser** ✅
  - JavaScript was reading RenderCommandBatch fields in wrong order
  - Bincode serializes in declaration order: commands, viewport, frame_id
  - JavaScript was trying to read frame_id first
  - Added support for missing command variants (SetClipRect, ClearClipRect, PushState, PopState)
  - Batches now parse successfully with 4 commands per frame
  
- **WebGL Rendering Partially Working** ✅
  - Clear command executes - screen shows grey Discord background (0.133, 0.137, 0.153)
  - Commands are received and parsed correctly
  - DrawQuad (red rectangle) not yet visible - needs WebGL implementation check
  
- **Debugging Improvements** ✅
  - Added sendLog() to JavaScript for server-side logging from browser
  - Better error messages showing exact parsing failures
  - Hex dump of received bytes for debugging

### Previous Session (2025-08-21 - Session 5)
- **Created complete WebGL renderer for browser** ✅
  - webgl/context.js - WebGL2 context management
  - webgl/shaders.js - Shader compilation and programs  
  - webgl/buffers.js - Vertex/index buffer batching
  - webgl/renderer.js - Command execution engine
  - webgl/textures.js - Texture management
  - webgl/text.js - Canvas-based text rendering
  
- **Completed render pipeline** ✅
  - Added render() method to UiSystem that generates RenderCommandBatch
  - Created batch_manager for frame-based command batching
  - Wired up 60fps render loop in SystemsManager
  - Updated app.js to use WebGL instead of Canvas2D
  
- **Fixed compilation issues** ✅
  - Removed duplicate render() methods
  - Fixed RenderCommandBatch frame_id parameter
  - Adjusted for missing networking APIs (send_packet)
  
- **Remaining issue** ⚠️
  - ECS spawn_batch doesn't work with trait objects (dyn Component)
  - Need to fix entity creation to avoid trait object type erasure
  - Created UiInterface in systems/logic for clean plugin access
  
- **Established proper render pipeline architecture** ✅
  - Created RenderingInterface in systems/logic 
  - Updated SystemsManager to expose UI and rendering interfaces
  - Plugins now use systems/logic World, not their own ECS
  - Clean separation between plugin state and UI system internals
  
- **Updated UI Framework Plugin** ✅
  - Removed playground-core-ecs dependency completely
  - Changed to use UiInterface instead of direct UiSystem access
  - Uses high-level create_discord_layout() method
  - Now compiles successfully with zero errors

### Architecture Rules Clarified
- **NO unsafe code** - Ever
- **NO std::any::Any** - Use enums and serialization
- **NO super** - Explicit trait implementations only
- **NO turbofish** - Use ComponentId instead
- **Files under 1000 lines** - Split large files into directories
- **lib.rs/mod.rs exports only** - No implementation code
- **Systems use core/ecs internally** for state management
- **Plugins ARE Systems** in systems/logic World
- **systems/logic manages ALL systems** including plugins

### Rendering Architecture Plan
```
core/rendering (DONE)
  ↓ defines base contracts
systems/rendering 
  ↓ implements WebGL/Vulkan renderers
systems/ui
  ↓ generates RenderCommands
UI Framework Plugin
  ↓ creates Discord-style UI
Browser (app.js)
  ↓ executes commands via WebGL
```

### Current Compilation Status
- ✅ **Core layer** - All packages compile successfully
- ✅ **Systems layer** - All packages compile successfully
- ✅ **Plugins layer** - UI Framework plugin compiles successfully
- ✅ **Apps layer** - playground-editor builds successfully

### Next Immediate Steps (Session 9)
1. **Fix DrawQuad rendering in WebGL** - Red rectangle should be visible
   - Check WebGL shader uniforms and vertex data
   - Verify transform matrices and viewport setup
2. **Fix client tracking in Dashboard** - Remove disconnected clients properly
   - Currently clients accumulate and never get removed
3. **Add verbose logging toggle** - Too many debug logs flooding dashboard
   - Add environment variable or config for debug level
4. **Implement Discord UI layout** - Get actual UI elements rendering
   - Fix ECS entity spawning for UI elements
   - Generate proper render commands from UI tree

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Currently builds successfully
```

### Key Architecture Points
- Apps → Plugins → Systems → Core (strict layering)
- Browser is pure view, server has all logic
- Render commands sent via WebSocket channel 10
- 60fps frame batching for efficiency
