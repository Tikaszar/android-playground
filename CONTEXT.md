# CONTEXT.md - Session Continuity

This file captures the current development session context for seamless continuation in future sessions.

## Current Session - 2025-12-19

**Focus**: Correcting Architecture - Systems/Logic Initializes All Systems
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Proper architectural flow implemented

### Session Objective
Fix the architectural flow so systems/logic initializes all other systems, maintaining proper layer separation.

### Critical Architecture Correction ✅

**Previous Misunderstanding**: 
- Thought Plugins could create NetworkingSystem directly
- Thought Apps managed all system initialization separately

**Correct Architecture** (Now Implemented):
1. **playground-editor** (App) creates **systems/logic** (ECS)
2. **systems/logic** internally:
   - Creates **core/ecs** for its own state management
   - Initializes ALL other systems (networking, ui, rendering, physics)
3. **systems/networking** (initialized by logic):
   - Creates and manages connection to **core/server**
   - Uses **core/ecs** internally for state management
4. **App passes systems to Plugins** through Context
5. **Plugins use provided systems**, NEVER create their own

### Implementation Details

#### SystemsManager Added to systems/logic
Created `systems/logic/src/systems_manager.rs`:
- Initializes NetworkingSystem (which connects to core/server)
- Initializes UiSystem (uses core/ecs internally)
- Initializes RenderingSystem (uses core/ecs internally)
- Provides unified access to all systems

#### ECS Enhanced with System Initialization
Updated `systems/logic/src/world.rs`:
- Added `initialize_systems()` method to ECS
- Stores SystemsManager reference
- Apps call this once to initialize entire engine

#### playground-editor Simplified
- Only imports `playground-logic`
- Creates ECS, calls `initialize_systems()`
- Gets all systems through the returned SystemsManager
- Passes systems to plugins when loading them

### Session Achievements - Phase 3 Complete ✅

Successfully created the **Conversational IDE Application**:

#### Application Created (`apps/conversational-ide/`):
1. **Cargo.toml** - Proper app configuration with axum server
2. **src/main.rs** - Standalone server on port 3001 serving static files
3. **static/index.html** - Full Discord-style chat interface
4. **static/styles.css** - Dark theme with proper Discord aesthetics
5. **static/app.js** - WebSocket client connecting to channels 1200-1209

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Discord-Style Layout**:
  - Left sidebar: Channels (#general, #code-review, #debugging) and DMs
  - Center: Chat messages with inline components
  - Right sidebar: Active files, task queue, quick terminal
  
- **WebSocket Integration**:
  - Connects to core server at ws://localhost:8080/ws
  - Registers for UI Framework Plugin channels (1200-1209)
  - Handles binary and JSON packet formats
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

- **Inline Components**:

- ✅ Ready for WebSocket integration on channels 1200-1209

### Architectural Insights Discovered

#### MCP Implementation Status (from git history review)
1. **✅ FIXED**: MCP server is now fully functional!
   - Streamable-HTTP transport implemented (commit 8ef9697)
   - Protocol version updated to `2025-06-18` (latest official)
   - Added critical `endpoint-ready` message on SSE connection
   - Session management with temp → permanent ID migration
   - Tool calls forwarded to channel 1050 (chat-assistant)

2. **Working MCP Flow**:
   - GET `/mcp` → SSE stream for server→client events
   - POST `/mcp` → JSON-RPC requests from client
   - Responses sent via SSE channel when Accept: text/event-stream
   - Tools like `show_file`, `update_editor` etc. are functional

#### Critical Architecture Gap Identified
1. **Problem**: MCP tools send to channel 1050 (chat-assistant) but chat-assistant doesn't control the browser UI
2. **Solution**: Need a dedicated **UI Framework Plugin** that:
   - Listens for MCP tool calls on its own channel (1200-1209)
   - Manages browser UI state for the entire IDE
   - Coordinates UI updates from all plugins
   - Sends rendering commands to browser via WebSocket

### Architectural Decisions Made

#### MCP Integration into Systems Layer
- **MCP should be in systems/networking**, not just in core/server
- Plugins need access to MCP through Systems APIs
- This maintains architectural integrity: Plugins → Systems → Core

#### UI Framework Plugin Design
- Must use **systems/logic ECS** for all state management
- Uses **systems/networking** for WebSocket and MCP communication
- Uses **systems/ui** for generic UI components
- NO direct Core access (follows architectural rules)

### Implementation Plan

1. **Integrate MCP into systems/networking**:
   - Create MCP client interface in systems/networking
   - Expose MCP tool registration and handling
   - Maintain channel-based architecture

2. **Create UI Framework Plugin with ECS**:
   - Define ECS components for panels, layout, focus state
   - Use systems/logic for all state management
   - Register on channels 1200-1209

3. **Update MCP forwarding**:
   - Change from channel 1050 to 1200 for UI updates
   - Route different tools to appropriate handlers

#### Code Changes This Session
1. **Fixed `.mcp.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "android-playground": {
         "type": "sse",
         "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Updated `mcp/server.rs`**:
   - Added `.post(handle_jsonrpc_request)` to SSE route
   - Modified `handle_jsonrpc_request` to send responses via SSE channel
   - Added logging to debug request/response flow

3. **Updated `mcp/sse_handler.rs`**:
   - Removed initial notification (Claude doesn't expect it)
   - Set up clean SSE stream for server-to-client events

### Key Insights
- MCP over SSE is **NOT** standard request/response
- It's an event stream (SSE) for server→client, HTTP POST for client→server
- Responses to POST requests should go through SSE channel, not HTTP response
- Need proper session tracking to associate POST requests with SSE connections

### Session Achievements - UI Framework Design

#### ✅ Conversational IDE Architecture Designed
1. **Discord-Style Chat System**:
   - Multiple channels (group chats, DMs, system)
   - Everything happens in chat bubbles (code editing, file browsing, terminal)
   - Three bubble states: Collapsed, Compressed (relevant), Expanded
   - Server-side persistence of all conversations
   - Independent from traditional IDE (both exist side-by-side)

2. **Inline Components**:
   - InlineEditor: Full code editing in chat bubbles
   - InlineFileBrowser: Navigate files within chat
   - InlineTerminal: Run commands in chat
   - InlineDiff: View changes in chat
   - All components expandable/collapsible

3. **UI Layout**:
   ```
   [Main Top Bar]
   [Conversation Top Bar: Expand/Collapse/Compress All | #channel-name | Actions]
   [Left Sidebar: Users & Conversations]
   [Center: Chat View with Bubbles]
   [Right Sidebar: IDE Tools (Terminal, etc)]
   ```

#### ✅ Multi-Agent Orchestration System Designed
1. **Agent Architecture**:
   - Orchestrator: Manages tasks, assigns work, monitors progress
   - Workers: Execute tasks in git worktrees
   - Human: Ultimate authority, all conversations visible
   
2. **Context Switching via Git Worktrees**:
   - Each agent = worktree + conversation
   - Switch: `cd ../worker-1 && claude --continue`
   - MCP `execute_command` tool handles switching
   - Single LLM instance, multiple personalities

3. **Task Queue System**:
   - Server manages task queue
   - Orchestrator assigns tasks to agents
   - Agents mark status: Busy/Idle/Waiting
   - When idle, server switches agent to next task

4. **Orchestrator Context Management**:
   - Maintains context files (CONTEXT.md, GOALS_*.md, DESIGN.md)
   - Creates new conversation at 35-50% context usage
   - Preserves memory across context resets

### Files Modified This Session (Phase 2)
- `/test/conversational-ide.html` - Complete Discord-style IDE interface
- `/test/conversational-ide.js` - WebSocket client for UI Framework Plugin
- `/plugins/ui-framework/src/websocket_handler.rs` - NEW: WebSocket communication handler
- `/plugins/ui-framework/src/lib.rs` - Added websocket_handler module
- `/core/server/src/mcp/streamable_http.rs` - Updated to forward tool calls to channel 1200

### Debug Information
Server logs show:
```
MCP SSE client connected: [uuid]
GET /mcp/sse - 200 OK
```

But no POST requests are logged, suggesting Claude is waiting for something from SSE first or the POST is failing before our handler.

**Focus**: ECS Implementation, Architecture Cleanup, and Plugin Development
**Completed**: Two-layer ECS, architectural violation fixes, core IDE plugins

## Session Achievements

### ✅ Established 4-Layer Architecture

Successfully documented and clarified the complete engine architecture:

1. **Apps Layer** (Top)
   - Complete products (games, IDEs)
   - Manage and coordinate collections of plugins
   - Examples: playground-editor, idle-mmo-rpg

2. **Plugins Layer**
   - Reusable feature modules
   - Use Systems APIs ONLY (never Core directly)
   - Examples: inventory, combat, chat, editor-core
   - Exception: May implement custom Systems internally

3. **Systems Layer**
   - Engine components
   - Use Core APIs ONLY
   - Provide: ui, networking, rendering, physics, logic
   - Register channels 1-999 with core/server

4. **Core Layer** (Foundation)
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Provides: types, server, client, plugin, android
   - WebSocket multiplexer and channel management

### ✅ WebSocket-Only Networking Design

Established complete WebSocket architecture (NO WebRTC):

1. **Binary Protocol**
   - Custom packet structure with channel routing
   - Frame-based batching (configurable, default 60fps)
   - Priority queues per channel (5 levels)
   - Serialization using `bytes` crate

2. **Channel System**
   - Channel 0: Control (registration, discovery)
   - Channels 1-999: Systems
   - Channels 1000+: Plugins/Apps
   - Dynamic runtime registration
   - KV store for discovery

3. **Authentication**
   - Passkey with 1Password integration
   - Google OAuth for external access
   - Server-side 1Password API primary

4. **WASM Compilation Strategies**
   - Separate: Each System, Plugin, App as .wasm
   - Hybrid: Each System and App as .wasm
   - Unified: Complete App as single .wasm

## Technical Design Decisions

### Architectural Rules Established

1. **Strict Layer Separation**
   - Apps → Plugins → Systems → Core
   - Plugins NEVER use Core directly
   - Systems NEVER depend on other Systems
   - All networking through core/server

2. **Server Authority**
   - Browser is purely a view
   - All logic/state on server
   - No client-side decision making

3. **Communication Flow**
   - Plugin → System → core/server → WebSocket → core/client → System → Plugin
   - Frame-based batching always (no immediate sends)
   - Binary protocol for efficiency

### Current Implementation Status

**core/server**: ✅ Full WebSocket multiplexer with binary protocol, channel system, and frame batching
**core/client**: ✅ WASM module created with channel management and WebSocket connection
**systems/networking**: Skeleton only, needs full implementation
**systems/ui**: No WebSocket code yet - waiting for systems integration

## Current Session - ECS Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Focus**: Two-layer ECS Architecture Implementation
**Status**: ✅ BOTH core/ecs AND systems/logic COMPLETED

### ECS Design Decisions

After extensive discussion with the user, the following design decisions were made:

#### Two-Layer Architecture
1. **core/ecs**: Minimal ECS primitives for Systems to use internally
2. **systems/logic**: Full-featured game ECS for Plugins and Apps

#### Key Requirements Specified by User

**Core Architecture**:
- Generational IDs (reliable, safe, no crashes)
- Systems implement their own storage strategies
- Runtime component registration for hot-loading
- MUST be async and multithreaded from the core
- Soft-fail philosophy - graceful error handling

**API Design**:
- Builder pattern for queries
- Events as components (unified ECS approach)
- Batch operations ONLY (no single-entity APIs)
- Query caching with automatic invalidation

**Memory Management**:
- Global component pool with incremental growth
- Incremental per-frame garbage collection
- Memory warnings based on growth rate analysis
- Component pools to prevent memory exhaustion

**Networking**:
- Built-in NetworkedComponent trait
- Sync on dirty, batched per frame
- Binary serialization using `bytes` crate
- User-specified networking flow via Systems

**Hot-Reload**:
- Custom migration functions supported
- Automatic migration in dev/debug mode
- Strict version checking in release mode
- Stateless systems (state in Plugins/Apps only)

**System Dependencies**:
- Type-based: `depends_on<PhysicsSystem>`
- Retry logic: 3 attempts then halt
- Safe mode for disabling failing systems

### Implementation Plan

1. Create core/ecs with async World and entity management
2. Implement component storage traits and registration
3. Add binary serialization with bytes
4. Create systems/logic with hybrid archetype storage
5. Implement builder queries with caching
6. Add NetworkedComponent and dirty tracking
7. Implement incremental GC system
8. Create system scheduler with dependencies

**Core/ECS Layer:**
- Safe, async, batch-only operations
- No unsafe code or Any usage
- Complete memory management and GC
- Foundation for Systems' internal use

**Systems/Logic Layer:**
- Full-featured game ECS for Plugins/Apps
- Hybrid storage combining archetype and sparse
- Parallel system execution with dependencies
- NetworkedComponent trait for replication
- Event system using components
- Query caching and builder pattern
- Multiple scheduler strategies

The architecture maintains strict layer separation with Core providing minimal primitives that Systems build upon, while Systems/Logic provides the rich API that Plugins and Apps need for game development.

## MCP Integration Session - 2025-08-17 (Latest)

### ✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation

Successfully integrated MCP server into core/server for universal LLM support:

#### Key Architecture Insights
1. **Bidirectional Communication**:
   - Browser IDE sends prompts to Claude Code (or any LLM) via MCP
   - Claude Code has the actual codebase/files
   - Claude Code calls MCP tools to update the browser display
   - Conversational IDE in browser replaces terminal interface

2. **UI-Focused Tools Created**:
   - `show_file` - Display file content in editor
   - `update_editor` - Update current editor content  
   - `show_terminal_output` - Display terminal output
   - `update_file_tree` - Update file browser
   - `show_diff` - Display diff view
   - `show_error` - Show error messages
   - `update_status_bar` - Update status
   - `show_notification` - Display notifications
   - `open_panel` - Open IDE panels
   - `show_chat_message` - Display chat messages

3. **Deep Server Integration**:
   - MCP is part of core/server (not separate process)
   - Uses existing WebSocket infrastructure
   - Leverages channel manager (LLMs get channels dynamically)
   - Uses frame batcher for efficient packet delivery
   - Mounted at `/mcp` endpoints

4. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Each LLM gets its own session and channel
   - Can broadcast prompts to all LLMs or target specific ones
   - Sessions tracked with activity monitoring
   - SSE for server→LLM, HTTP POST for LLM→server

#### Files Created/Modified
- `core/server/src/mcp/` - Complete MCP implementation
  - `server.rs` - Main MCP server integrated with WebSocketState
  - `ui_tools.rs` - UI update tools that LLMs call
  - `protocol.rs` - MCP protocol messages
  - `session.rs` - Session management for multiple LLMs
  - `error.rs` - Error types
- `plugins/chat-assistant/src/mcp_client.rs` - MCP client for chat plugin
- Removed `core/mcp` as separate crate (integrated into core/server)

### Next Session Starting Points
1. **Fix MCP SSE Connection** - Complete the SSE/JSON-RPC implementation
2. **Test MCP with Claude Code** - Connect actual Claude Code instance
3. **Implement terminal plugin** - For non-MCP terminal needs
4. **Enhance chat-assistant** - Full MCP client integration
5. **Test multiple LLMs** - Connect Claude Code, GPT, etc. simultaneously
6. **Implement remaining IDE plugins** - lsp-client, debugger, version-control
7. **Begin game plugin implementations** - inventory, combat, etc.
