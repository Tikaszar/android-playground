# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-27 (Session 33)

### Current Status
**Build**: âœ… COMPLETE - All systems fully functional
**Architecture**: âœ… Complete compliance achieved  
**Rendering**: ðŸ”´ Black screen - pipeline exists but not rendering
**Networking**: âœ… Fixed packet broadcasting - all clients receive packets
**Channels**: âœ… Dynamic channel allocation fully implemented
**Browser**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially working - connects but manifest not received

### Session 33 Progress

#### ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS: UI Rendering Pipeline Fix
- **Issue**: Black screen despite complete pipeline
- **Diagnosed**:
  1. UiSystem was hardcoded to channel 10, now uses dynamic channel 1 âœ…
  2. Browser logs properly route through sendLog() to server âœ…
  3. Browser waits for channel manifest before initialization âœ…
  4. **PROBLEM**: Server not sending channel manifest (type 9) when browser requests (type 8)
  5. Browser connects, waits, but never receives manifest
  6. Without manifest, browser can't discover channels or render
  
- **Fixed**:
  1. Added `set_channel_id()` method to UiSystem
  2. SystemsManager sets channel ID after dynamic allocation
  3. Browser initialization sequence waits for manifest
  4. All console.log replaced with sendLog() for Termux visibility
  5. WebGL renderer logs through window.uiClient.sendLog()
  
- **Still Needed**:
  - Server must respond to RequestChannelManifest (type 8) with manifest (type 9)
  - Currently no handler for type 8 in handle_control_message()
  - Browser disconnects after 2 seconds without receiving manifest

### Session 31 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Dynamic Channel System Implementation
- **Goal**: Remove all hardcoded channel numbers (except channel 0)
- **Completed**:
  1. Created ChannelRegistry in SystemsManager with dynamic allocation
  2. Added channel discovery protocol messages to control channel 0
  3. Modified plugins to use Handle<T> pattern correctly (NO Arc usage)
  4. All 8 IDE plugins now request channels dynamically
  5. UiFrameworkPlugin requests 10 dynamic channels
  6. Connected WebSocketState to SystemsManager via callback mechanism
  7. Implemented binary serialized channel manifest with bincode
  8. Fixed all Arc usage violations - now using Handle/Shared exclusively
  
- **Architecture**:
  - Channel 0: Reserved for control/discovery (ONLY hardcoded)
  - All others: Dynamically allocated starting from 1
  - Browser discovers channels via manifest on connection
  - Complete flexibility for adding/removing components
  - SystemsManager maintains ChannelRegistry
  - NetworkingSystem passes callback to WebSocketState
  - WebSocketState calls back to get manifest when browser requests

- **Build Status**: âœ… Fully compiles with only minor warnings

### Session 30 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Browser Debug Logging Fixed
- **Issue**: sendLog function was missing in browser client
- **Solution**: Added sendLog function to app.js that sends logs to server on channel 0, packet type 200
- **Result**: Browser debug logs, including render debugging, now properly sent to server dashboard

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed Packet Broadcasting and Queue Buildup
- **Root causes identified**: 
  1. batcher.rs `get_batch()` was draining queue (only one client got packets)
  2. MessageBridge was bypassing batcher, sending directly to clients
  3. NetworkingSystem had redundant PacketQueue that never flushed
  
- **Solutions implemented**: 
  - Added `broadcast_queues` to FrameBatcher for shared packet access
  - Created `prepare_broadcast_batches()` that clears old and prepares new broadcasts
  - MessageBridge now queues packets in batcher instead of direct send
  - Removed redundant PacketQueue.enqueue in NetworkingSystem
  - Global broadcast task prepares packets once per frame for all clients
  
- **Result**: Packets properly flow through batcher and broadcast to all clients

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Splitting system.rs for Architecture Compliance
- **Violation Fixed**: system.rs was 1190 lines (exceeds 1000-line rule)
- **Created directory structure**: `/systems/ui/src/system/`
- **All files created**:
  - `mod.rs` - Exports only (per rules)
  - `core.rs` - UiSystem struct and basic methods (122 lines)
  - `init.rs` - Initialization and setup (145 lines)
  - `elements.rs` - Element management (196 lines)
  - `layout.rs` - Layout and dirty tracking (47 lines)
  - `rendering.rs` - Rendering logic and batch sending (225 lines)
  - `shaders.rs` - Shader source code (107 lines)
  - `ui_renderer_impl.rs` - UiRenderer trait implementation (210 lines)
- **Deleted**: Old monolithic system.rs file
- **Fixed**: All duplicate method definitions
- **NO super compliance**: All imports use crate-relative paths
- **Result**: Package compiles successfully!

### Key Architecture Rules Enforced
- **NO Search/Grep** - Read files directly only
- **Read files FULLY** in one pass
- **mod.rs/lib.rs ONLY export** - No implementation
- **Files under 1000 lines**
- **NO dyn, NO any, NO turbofish, NO unsafe**
- **Shared<> for internal, Handle<> for external**

### Next Steps
1. **Test packet broadcasting** âœ…:
   - Run the editor: `cargo run -p playground-apps-editor`
   - Open multiple browser tabs to http://localhost:8080/playground-editor/
   - Verify all clients receive render packets

2. **Verify Discord UI rendering**:
   - Check UI Framework Plugin creates elements properly
   - Ensure render_element_tree() generates correct commands
   - Confirm WebGL renderer displays Discord UI layout

3. **Implement dynamic channel system** (Session 28 goal):
   - SystemsManager channel registry
   - Channel discovery protocol on channel 0
   - Remove remaining hardcoded channels

### Running the IDE
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor
```

Then browse to: http://localhost:8080/playground-editor/

### Expected Behavior
- Browser should connect via WebSocket
- Currently: Packets queue up, nothing renders
- Goal: All clients receive render packets via broadcast
