# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-28 (Session 36)

### Current Status
**Build**: âœ… COMPLETE - playground-apps-editor builds successfully
**Architecture**: âœ… Complete compliance achieved  
**Rendering**: ðŸŸ¡ Pipeline ready - waiting for test
**Networking**: âœ… Fixed packet broadcasting - all clients receive packets
**Channels**: ðŸ”´ UI Framework refactored but main.rs still pre-registering channels
**Browser**: âœ… Fixed - endianness issue resolved, manifest working
**Lifecycle**: âœ… Fixed circular dependency in startup

### Session 36 Accomplishments

#### âœ… COMPLETED: UI Framework Plugin Refactored to Single Channel
- **Issue**: UI Framework Plugin was requesting 10 channels unnecessarily
- **Root Cause**: Legacy design from before dynamic channel system was implemented
  - Plugin was allocating channels "ui-framework-0" through "ui-framework-9"
  - Checking all 10 channels every frame in run() method
  - Browser expected multiple ui-framework-* channels

- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Plugin Changes** (plugins/ui-framework/src/plugin.rs):
     - Removed `channel_range: Vec<u16>` field
     - Changed from 10 channels to single "ui-framework" channel
     - Updated run() to check single channel instead of loop
     - Added handle_packet() method routing by packet_type
     - Split handlers: handle_mcp_tool_call(), handle_panel_update(), handle_chat_message()
  
  2. **Packet Types** (new file: plugins/ui-framework/src/packet_types.rs):
     - Created constants for message type differentiation
     - Browserâ†’server types (1-99)
     - Serverâ†’browser types (100-199)
  
  3. **Browser Updates** (apps/playground-editor/static/app.js):
     - Changed UI_FRAMEWORK_CHANNELS array to single UI_FRAMEWORK_CHANNEL
     - Updated discovery to look for "ui-framework" not "ui-framework-*"
     - Fixed sendToUIFramework() to use single channel

- **Benefits**:
  - Saves 9 channels for other plugins
  - Simpler code without array management
  - Better performance (1 channel check vs 10 per frame)
  - Follows architecture (one channel per plugin)

#### ðŸ”´ DISCOVERED: main.rs Pre-Registration Issue
- **Problem Found**: main.rs is ALSO registering channels before plugins initialize!
  - Lines 43-53: Registers "ui-framework" and "ui-framework-1" through "ui-framework-9"
  - Other plugins also being pre-registered (lines 50-117)
  - This causes duplicate registrations and wastes channels 2-10

- **Why It's Wrong**:
  - Channels are allocated sequentially (first-come, first-served)
  - NOT ranges (no "1-999 for systems" or "1000+ for plugins")
  - main.rs registers channels, then plugins try to register again
  - Results in: Channel 19 (UI), 20 (ui-framework), 2-10 (ui-framework-1 to 9), etc.

- **Fix Needed**:
  - main.rs should NOT pre-register ANY channels
  - Plugins should register their own channels in initialize()
  - OR plugins should get channel passed from main.rs registration

### Session 35 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed Browser-Server Endianness Mismatch
- Fixed all DataView operations to use little-endian
- Browser can now properly request and receive channel manifest
- All control channel messages work correctly

### Next Steps for Session 37
1. **Fix channel registration pattern**:
   - Decide: Should plugins register during Phase 1 (in main.rs) or Phase 3 (in initialize)?
   - Fix duplicate registration issue
   - Ensure channels 2-10 aren't wasted

2. **Test UI rendering**:
   - Verify single UI Framework channel works
   - Check Discord UI renders properly
   - Confirm all message types route correctly

3. **Clean up warnings**:
   - Fix unused packet type constants
   - Handle Result from orchestrator.process_pending_updates()
