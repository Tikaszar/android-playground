# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-21 (Session 3)

### Current Status
**Core compilation issues fixed, ready for UI Framework implementation** - Core/Systems compile, plugins need work

### What Was Done This Session (2025-08-21 - Session 3)
- **Fixed all compilation errors in Core and Systems layers** ✅
  - Removed last DashMap usage in systems/networking/channel_manager.rs
  - Fixed all SerializationError → SerializationFailed references
  - Added playground-core-rendering to systems/logic dependencies
  - Fixed Vec<u8> to Bytes conversions in UI system
  - Added missing .await on async function calls
  - Cleaned up unused mut warnings

- **Redesigned ECS mutable component access** ✅
  - Removed broken get_component_mut that returned Shared<ComponentBox>
  - Added update_component<T> method that uses closures for safe updates
  - Updated all UI layout systems to use new update pattern
  - Fixed all field access on components (no more Arc<RwLock<Box<dyn Component>>>)

- **Fixed UI rendering system** ✅
  - Fixed theme variable scoping issues
  - Fixed ElementBounds type references
  - Updated input manager to use update_component pattern
  - Temporarily disabled send_to_channel (needs proper implementation)

### Architecture Rules Clarified
- **NO unsafe code** - Ever
- **NO std::any::Any** - Use enums and serialization
- **NO super** - Explicit trait implementations only
- **NO turbofish** - Use ComponentId instead
- **Files under 1000 lines** - Split large files into directories
- **lib.rs/mod.rs exports only** - No implementation code
- **Systems use core/ecs internally** for state management
- **Plugins ARE Systems** in systems/logic World
- **systems/logic manages ALL systems** including plugins

### Rendering Architecture Plan
```
core/rendering (DONE)
  ↓ defines base contracts
systems/rendering 
  ↓ implements WebGL/Vulkan renderers
systems/ui
  ↓ generates RenderCommands
UI Framework Plugin
  ↓ creates Discord-style UI
Browser (app.js)
  ↓ executes commands via WebGL
```

### Current Compilation Status
- ✅ **Core layer** - All packages compile successfully
- ✅ **Systems layer** - All packages compile with warnings only
- ❌ **Plugins layer** - UI Framework plugin has ~31 errors (needs update for new UI system API)
- ❌ **Apps layer** - Blocked by plugin compilation

### Next Immediate Steps (Session 4)
1. **Fix UI Framework Plugin compilation** - Update to use new UI system APIs
2. **Implement proper networking/channel integration** - send_to_channel needs real implementation
3. **Test full compilation of playground-editor**
4. **Implement WebGL rendering in browser** (update app.js)
5. **Fix UI rendering** (black screen issue)
6. **Get Discord-style UI working**

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Currently builds successfully
```

### Key Architecture Points
- Apps → Plugins → Systems → Core (strict layering)
- Browser is pure view, server has all logic
- Render commands sent via WebSocket channel 10
- 60fps frame batching for efficiency
