# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-23 (Session 12)

### Current Status
**Critical Deadlock Issue in ECS World** - Multiple async lock deadlocks preventing UI creation

### What Was Done This Session (2025-08-23 - Session 12)
- **Dashboard Logging Implementation** ‚úÖ
  - Replaced all `tracing::info!` calls with dashboard logging
  - Added `log()` method to UiSystem that uses NetworkingSystem's dashboard
  - Dashboard now properly captures all UI system operations
  - Logs show exact hang location: `world.remove_component_raw()`
  
- **Identified Multiple Deadlock Issues** ‚ùå
  1. **First Deadlock**: `world.update_component()` called while holding world read lock
     - Fixed by using manual remove/add operations
  2. **Second Deadlock**: Holding write guard across async await points
     - Attempted fix with scoped blocks - didn't work
  3. **Root Cause**: Fundamental architecture issue with async locks in ECS
  
- **Debugging Progress** üìä
  - UI elements ARE created successfully (entities 1-5)
  - Hang occurs when setting style on first element
  - Specifically hangs in `remove_component_raw()` at line 373
  - The method tries to acquire internal locks while we hold outer lock
  
- **Architecture Problems Found** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - `Shared<World>` with internal `Shared<HashMap>` fields causes nested locking
  - Async methods on World can't be called safely while holding World lock
  - The ECS design with nested RwLocks is fundamentally problematic for async
  - Need to redesign how components are updated without nested locks
  
- **Implemented UiRenderer in systems/ui** ‚úÖ
  - UiSystem now implements core/ui::UiRenderer trait
  - Proper mapping between core types and internal types
  - Fixed set_element_text to actually update components
  - Added mobile orientation and safe area support
  
- **Enhanced systems/logic UiInterface** ‚úÖ
  - Added mobile Discord UI methods
  - create_mobile_discord_layout() for phone screens
  - create_mobile_channel_list() with touch-friendly sizing
  - add_message() for Discord-style messages
  - Proper drawer navigation for mobile
  
- **Updated UI Framework Plugin** ‚úÖ
  - Uses new mobile Discord layout
  - Hamburger menu for channel drawer
  - Touch-optimized button sizes (40px height)
  - Mobile-friendly font sizes (16px minimum)
  - Proper Discord mobile colors and styling
  
- **Fixed Rendering Pipeline** ‚úÖ
  - render_element_tree() generates real commands
  - Panel and scrollview elements render properly
  - Text rendering with DrawText commands
  - Component updates work correctly

### Previous Session (2025-08-22 - Session 10)

  - Mobile-first UI types and commands
  - Touch gestures and mobile-specific events
  - No implementation, pure contracts
  
- **Implemented UiRenderer in systems/ui** ‚úÖ
  - UiSystem now implements core/ui::UiRenderer trait
  - Fixed set_element_text to actually update components
  - Added mobile orientation handling
  - Proper mapping between core and internal types
  
- **Enhanced UiInterface for Mobile** ‚úÖ
  - Added create_mobile_discord_layout()

  - UI elements now being created properly

### Previous Session (2025-08-22 - Session 9)
- **Fixed Complete WebGL Rendering Pipeline** ‚úÖ
  - Added shader program activation in executeCommandBatch() before drawing
  - Fixed projection matrix setup and uniform binding  
  - DrawQuad now renders correctly - red rectangle visible at (100, 100)
  - Added isInitialized() method to check renderer state
  - Both Clear and DrawQuad commands working perfectly
  
- **Implemented Server-Controlled Renderer Initialization** ‚úÖ
  - Added RendererInit, LoadShader, LoadTexture message types
  - Server sends initialization with default shaders on client connect
  - No std::any::Any - uses enums and bincode serialization
  - Shaders sent from server and compiled on client
  
- **Added Resource Caching System** ‚úÖ
  - Created ResourceCache class with LRU eviction
  - Caches compiled shaders and textures for reconnection
  - 100MB memory limit with automatic eviction
  - Preserves resources across disconnect/reconnect
  
- **Implemented Clean Shutdown Protocol** ‚úÖ
  - RendererShutdown message for clean disposal
  - Proper WebGL resource cleanup (VAOs, buffers, shaders)
  - Memory freed on disconnect
  - No resource leaks
  
- **Debugging Improvements** ‚úÖ
  - Added sendLog() to JavaScript for server-side logging from browser
  - Better error messages showing exact parsing failures
  - Hex dump of received bytes for debugging

### Previous Session (2025-08-21 - Session 5)

  - Need to fix entity creation to avoid trait object type erasure
  - Created UiInterface in systems/logic for clean plugin access
  
- **Established proper render pipeline architecture** ‚úÖ
  - Created RenderingInterface in systems/logic 
  - Updated SystemsManager to expose UI and rendering interfaces
  - Plugins now use systems/logic World, not their own ECS
  - Clean separation between plugin state and UI system internals
  
- **Updated UI Framework Plugin** ‚úÖ
  - Removed playground-core-ecs dependency completely
  - Changed to use UiInterface instead of direct UiSystem access
  - Uses high-level create_discord_layout() method
  - Now compiles successfully with zero errors

### Architecture Rules Clarified
- **NO unsafe code** - Ever
- **NO std::any::Any** - Use enums and serialization
- **NO super** - Explicit trait implementations only
- **NO turbofish** - Use ComponentId instead
- **Files under 1000 lines** - Split large files into directories
- **lib.rs/mod.rs exports only** - No implementation code
- **Systems use core/ecs internally** for state management
- **Plugins ARE Systems** in systems/logic World
- **systems/logic manages ALL systems** including plugins

### Rendering Architecture Plan
```
core/rendering (DONE)
  ‚Üì defines base contracts
systems/rendering 
  ‚Üì implements WebGL/Vulkan renderers
systems/ui
  ‚Üì generates RenderCommands
UI Framework Plugin
  ‚Üì creates Discord-style UI
Browser (app.js)
  ‚Üì executes commands via WebGL
```

### Current Compilation Status
- ‚úÖ **Core layer** - All packages compile successfully
- ‚úÖ **Systems layer** - All packages compile successfully
- ‚úÖ **Plugins layer** - UI Framework plugin compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ **Apps layer** - playground-editor builds successfully

### Issues Found
- **UI Framework Plugin not initializing** - The plugin's initialize() method was never called
- **Fixed in main.rs** - Now calls initialize() before registering the plugin
- **UI elements created but not rendering** - Need to verify the render_element_tree traversal

### Next Immediate Steps (Session 12)
1. **Fix UI Framework Plugin Hanging Issue**
   - Check terminal output for tracing logs when running
   - Identify if root element is None or if there's a deadlock
   - Fix the issue preventing Discord UI creation
   
2. **Test Mobile Discord UI in Browser** - After fixing the hang
   - Run `cargo run -p playground-apps-editor`
   - Open browser to http://localhost:8080/playground-editor/
   - Check if Discord UI elements appear
   - Test DrawText command in WebGL
   
2. **Implement Touch Event Handling** - Make UI interactive
   - Handle touch events from browser
   - Implement swipe to show/hide channel drawer
   - Add tap handlers for buttons and channels
   - Virtual keyboard integration for input
   
3. **Fix Text Rendering in WebGL** - DrawText command implementation
   - Implement text rendering in browser WebGL
   - Canvas-based text to texture approach
   - Proper font metrics and alignment
   
4. **Add Channel Switching** - Make Discord UI functional
   - Switch between channels on tap
   - Update message area based on selected channel
   - Show channel name in header
   - Animate drawer open/close

### Next Steps Required (Session 13)
1. **Fix ECS Deadlock Architecture** üî¥ CRITICAL
   - Option A: Remove nested Shared<> in World struct
   - Option B: Make component operations synchronous (non-async)
   - Option C: Use message passing instead of direct lock access
   - Option D: Redesign World to not need locks for component access
   
2. **Specific Fix Needed**
   - `world.remove_component_raw()` hangs trying to get `self.storages.read().await`
   - This happens while we already have a write lock on World
   - Even though they're separate locks, something is blocking
   - Possibly related to how async executors handle nested locks
   
3. **Temporary Workaround**
   - Skip style updates for now to unblock UI creation
   - Or pre-create all styles in components at creation time
   - Focus on getting basic UI working first

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Builds but hangs at runtime
```

### Key Architecture Points
- Apps ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Systems ‚Üí Core (strict layering)
- Browser is pure view, server has all logic
- Render commands sent via WebSocket channel 10
- 60fps frame batching for efficiency
- **PROBLEM**: Nested async RwLocks in ECS causing deadlocks
