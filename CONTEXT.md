# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-19

### Current Status
**FULLY COMPILING** ✅ - All build errors resolved! The playground-apps-editor now builds successfully.

### What Was Done This Session
- **Morning**: Fixed critical architecture violations
  - Plugin trait moved from core/plugin to systems/logic
  - Plugins now implement systems/logic::System trait
  - NetworkingSystem starts core/server internally
  - Fixed axum version mismatch (workspace version 0.8)

- **Afternoon**: Massive async/await refactoring
  - Replaced ALL `parking_lot::RwLock` with `tokio::sync::RwLock` 
  - Fixed 69+ async/await errors systematically
  - Created automation scripts for batch fixes
  - Made 100+ functions async throughout systems/logic
  - Resolved Send trait issues with RwLock guards

### Architecture Now Correct
```
Apps (playground-editor)
  ↓ creates systems/logic World
  ↓ creates SystemsManager 
  ↓ SystemsManager initializes all systems
  ↓ NetworkingSystem starts core/server internally
  ↓ Apps load Plugins and register as Systems
  ↓ Plugins only access Systems through systems/logic
```

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Builds and runs successfully!
```

### Next Steps
1. Test the running application
2. Verify MCP integration works
3. Test browser connection at http://localhost:8080/playground-editor/
4. Begin implementing actual functionality

### Key Learnings This Session
1. **Plugins ARE Systems** - No separate Plugin concept needed
2. **Only tokio::sync::RwLock allowed** - parking_lot causes Send issues across await
3. **Async propagates deeply** - One async function can require 100+ others to become async
4. **Automation is key** - Scripts for batch fixes saved hours of manual work
