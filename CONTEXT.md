# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-01-24 (Session 20)

### Current Status
**Component/ComponentData pattern FIXED** ‚úÖ - Removed erroneous ComponentData struct, fixed async traits
**systems/logic PARTIALLY FIXED** üü° - Component pattern corrected, some Event system issues remain
**systems/networking FIXED** ‚úÖ - All async ComponentData implementations complete
**systems/rendering FIXED** ‚úÖ - All async ComponentData implementations complete
**systems/ui MOSTLY FIXED** üü° - Component pattern corrected, builds with warnings

### What Was Done This Session (2025-01-24 - Session 20)

#### Major Fix: Corrected Component/ComponentData Pattern
1. **Identified the core issue** ‚úÖ
   - Session 19 erroneously created a new ComponentData struct in systems/logic
   - This was a migration attempt which is forbidden (no migrations in development)
   - Should have updated existing Component from trait to struct

2. **Fixed core/ecs ComponentData trait** ‚úÖ
   - Made serialize/deserialize methods async
   - Added #[async_trait] to the trait
   - Updated Component::new() to be async
   - Fixed Component::deserialize() to be async

3. **Removed erroneous component_data.rs** ‚úÖ
   - Deleted systems/logic/src/component_data.rs completely
   - Removed component_data module from lib.rs
   - No migration code or patterns

4. **Updated systems/logic Component** ‚úÖ
   - Changed Component from trait to concrete struct (base class pattern)
   - Added ComponentData trait for actual component types
   - Component stores Bytes internally for serialization
   - Matches the pattern from core/ecs exactly

5. **Fixed all usage sites** ‚úÖ
   - storage.rs: Changed ComponentData references to Component
   - world.rs: Changed ComponentData references to Component
   - archetype.rs: Changed ComponentData references to Component
   - Fixed all Component::new() calls to handle async
   - Fixed all component_id() calls to be trait-qualified

6. **Fixed all ComponentData implementations** ‚úÖ
   - systems/ui: Added #[async_trait] and async methods
   - systems/networking: Added async serialize/deserialize
   - systems/rendering: Added async serialize/deserialize
   - systems/logic events: Added proper ComponentData implementations

### Architecture Pattern Corrected
The correct pattern is now consistent across the codebase:
- `Component` is a concrete struct (base class) that wraps component data
- `ComponentData` is a trait that actual components implement
- `Component::new<T: ComponentData>(component)` creates the wrapper
- All serialize/deserialize methods are async per architecture rules

### Key Achievement
Successfully corrected the Component/ComponentData pattern without any migration code, maintaining the base class pattern and async-everywhere principle.

### Build Status
- core/ecs: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- systems/networking: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- systems/rendering: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
- systems/ui: ‚ö†Ô∏è Compiles with warnings
- systems/logic: ‚ùå Still has Event system issues (51 errors)
- Overall: ‚ùå Full workspace build incomplete

### Remaining Issues
1. systems/logic Event system needs more fixes
2. Some async propagation issues in systems/logic
3. Build warnings in various packages

### Next Steps Required
1. Complete Event system fixes in systems/logic
2. Fix remaining async propagation issues
3. Clean up build warnings
4. Test full workspace compilation
5. Verify Discord UI implementation works
