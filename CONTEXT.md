# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-19

### Current Status
Major architecture refactoring completed. Plugin system moved from Core to Systems/Logic where it belongs.

### What Was Done This Session
- Fixed critical architecture violation: Plugin trait moved from core/plugin to systems/logic
- Plugins now implement systems/logic::System trait (not a separate Plugin trait)
- Apps load plugins and register them as Systems in the World
- NetworkingSystem now starts core/server internally (not from Apps)
- Fixed axum version mismatch (all using workspace version 0.8)
- Removed core/plugin package entirely
- Updated UI Framework Plugin to implement System trait

### Current Build Status
**Partially Compiling** - Main architecture fixed, but UI Framework Plugin incomplete:
- Missing methods in McpHandler, UiState, Orchestrator
- Need to implement business logic for MCP tool handling
- Need to implement UI state persistence
- Need to implement update orchestration

### Architecture Now Correct
```
Apps (playground-editor)
  ↓ creates systems/logic World
  ↓ creates SystemsManager 
  ↓ SystemsManager initializes all systems
  ↓ NetworkingSystem starts core/server internally
  ↓ Apps load Plugins and register as Systems
  ↓ Plugins only access Systems through systems/logic
```

### Next Steps
1. Complete UI Framework Plugin implementation
2. Add missing methods (handle_tool_call, save_state, etc.)
3. Test full compilation
4. Test MCP integration
5. Verify browser connection

### Key Learning
Plugins ARE Systems in the systems/logic ECS. There's no separate Plugin concept - this keeps the architecture clean and prevents Core from knowing about higher-level concepts.
