### Session 41 Accomplishments

#### âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Config-Based System Loading Architecture

- **Created configuration-driven system loader**:
  1. Added `systems.toml` configuration file to control which systems load
  2. Systems can be marked as "always" load or feature-gated
  3. Supports multiple renderer implementations (WebGL, Vulkan future)
  4. IDE doesn't load physics, games don't load IDE-specific systems
  
- **Build-time code generation**:
  1. Created `build.rs` that reads systems.toml at compile time
  2. Generates `system_loader_impl.rs` with conditional loading logic
  3. Uses template string replacement for clean code generation
  4. No hardcoded system lists - fully configuration driven
  
- **Static loader API**:
  1. Created `system_loader.rs` with stable public API
  2. Includes generated implementation via `include!` macro
  3. Provides functions for loading, initializing, and accessing systems
  4. Clean separation between API and implementation
  
- **Architectural compliance maintained**:
  - Core doesn't know about Systems (no layer violation)
  - SystemsManager uses loader to initialize systems
  - Concrete types only (NO dyn compliance)
  - Handle/Shared pattern properly used throughout

### Session 40 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Robust WebGL Renderer Logging

- **Added component-specific logging to WebGL renderer**:
  1. WebGLRenderer now logs through core/server Dashboard directly
  2. Tracks frame count, command count, and operations
  3. Logs initialization, frame lifecycle, buffer operations, and resize events
  
- **Created browser page construction in systems/webgl**:
  1. Added `BrowserBuilder` module for generating HTML/JS
  2. Created `WebGLServerIntegration` for Axum route integration
  3. Generates complete WebGL client with WebSocket connection
  4. Client handles channel discovery and render command reception
  
### Next Session Plan

#### System Registration Implementation
1. **Add concrete system types to core/ecs**:
   - RenderSystem struct (no impl)
   - NetworkSystem struct (no impl)
   - UiSystem struct (no impl)
   - PhysicsSystem struct (no impl)
   
2. **Create SystemRegistry in core/ecs**:
   - Static registry with Option<ConcreteType> for each system
   - Registration functions for each system type
   - initialize_all_systems() to init all registered systems
   
3. **Implement self-registration in systems/**:
   - Add ctor dependency to each system
   - Use #[ctor] for auto-registration
   - Move implementations to impl blocks on core types
   
4. **Update SystemsManager**:
   - Remove direct system creation
   - Call core/ecs::initialize_all_systems()
   - Access systems through core/ecs registry

### Session 39 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Extended Component-Specific Logging to All Systems/Plugins/Apps

- **Exposed Logging API through systems/logic**:
  1. Added `log_component()` and `log()` methods to SystemsManager
  2. Re-exported `LogLevel` type for convenience in systems/logic
  3. Methods get Dashboard reference from NetworkingSystem
  
- **Updated Systems**:
  - NetworkingSystem: Now uses `log_component("systems/networking", ...)`
  - UiSystem: Already had component logging to "systems/ui"
  
- **Updated IDE Plugins**:
  - UI Framework Plugin: Converted all ~30+ log calls to component logging
  - Editor Core Plugin: Replaced tracing macros with SystemsManager logging
  - File Browser Plugin: Commented out tracing macros (ready for component logging)
  
- **Updated playground-editor App**:
  - Main initialization uses `log_component("apps/playground-editor", ...)`
  - Plugin spawn tasks still use eprintln (can't access SystemsManager in spawned tasks)

- **Build Status**: âœ… Fully compiling with only warnings

### Session 38 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Component-Specific Log Files Infrastructure
- **Feature**: Added distributed logging system for better debugging
  - Each component logs to its own file (e.g., `playground_editor_systems_ui_*.log`)
  - Dashboard displays all logs in unified view
  - Main server log still exists for overview
  
- **Implementation**:
  1. Added `component_log_files: Shared<HashMap<String, tokio::fs::File>>` to Dashboard
  2. Created `log_component()` method that routes logs to component-specific files
  3. Component logs created on-demand in `logs/` directory
  
- **Benefits**:
  - Much easier to debug specific components
  - No more massive single log file
  - Can tail specific component logs during debugging
  - Dashboard still shows unified view for monitoring

### Session 37 Accomplishments

#### âœ… FIXED: Dashboard Plugin Registration Issue
- **Issue**: UI Framework Plugin (channel 1) wasn't showing in dashboard logs
  - Plugin was registered in Phase 1 before dashboard existed
  - Other plugins (2-9) registered after and showed properly

- **Solution**: Proper lifecycle management in SystemsManager
  - Phase 1: `register_plugin()` only allocates channels, stores in registry
  - Phase 2: `initialize_all()` registers ALL plugins with dashboard after it's available
  - All plugins now properly logged in dashboard

#### âœ… FIXED: NO dyn Violations Reintroduced in Session 33
- **Issue**: Session 33's fix for circular dependencies introduced `Box<dyn System>` violations
  - World had `plugin_systems: Shared<Vec<Box<dyn System>>>`
  - SystemsManager had similar violation
  - This broke the NO dyn rule that was supposedly fixed

- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Removed all Box<dyn System>** from World and SystemsManager
  2. **Channel-based architecture**: 
     - Plugins run as independent tasks
     - Communication via channels only
     - No direct method calls on plugin instances
  3. **Proper Handle/Shared usage**:
     - Plugins receive `Handle<World>` (external reference)
     - Not cloning World or using Shared<World>
     - Follows rule: Handle for external, Shared for internal

- **Implementation Details**:
  - World now tracks `plugin_channels: Shared<Vec<(String, u16)>>` instead of plugin instances
  - SystemsManager has `plugin_registry: Shared<Vec<(String, u16)>>` for tracking
  - main.rs spawns each plugin as independent tokio task
  - Each plugin gets its own Handle<World> reference
  - Plugins initialize and run independently at 60fps

#### âœ… PROPER Channel Registration Flow
- **Phase 1**: Register channels with SystemsManager
  - SystemsManager allocates channels dynamically
  - Channels stored in registry for manifest generation
  
- **Phase 2**: Core systems initialize
  - NetworkingSystem can build complete channel manifest
  
- **Phase 3**: Plugin tasks spawn
  - Each plugin initialized with Handle<World>
  - Spawned as independent async task
  - Runs own 60fps update loop

### Session 36 Accomplishments

#### âœ… COMPLETED: UI Framework Plugin Refactored to Single Channel
- **Issue**: UI Framework Plugin was requesting 10 channels unnecessarily
- **Root Cause**: Legacy design from before dynamic channel system was implemented
  - Plugin was allocating channels "ui-framework-0" through "ui-framework-9"
  - Checking all 10 channels every frame in run() method
  - Browser expected multiple ui-framework-* channels

- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Plugin Changes** (plugins/ui-framework/src/plugin.rs):
     - Removed `channel_range: Vec<u16>` field
     - Changed from 10 channels to single "ui-framework" channel
     - Updated run() to check single channel instead of loop
     - Added handle_packet() method routing by packet_type
     - Split handlers: handle_mcp_tool_call(), handle_panel_update(), handle_chat_message()
  
  2. **Packet Types** (new file: plugins/ui-framework/src/packet_types.rs):
     - Created constants for message type differentiation
     - Browserâ†’server types (1-99)
     - Serverâ†’browser types (100-199)
  
  3. **Browser Updates** (apps/playground-editor/static/app.js):
     - Changed UI_FRAMEWORK_CHANNELS array to single UI_FRAMEWORK_CHANNEL
     - Updated discovery to look for "ui-framework" not "ui-framework-*"
     - Fixed sendToUIFramework() to use single channel

- **Benefits**:
  - Saves 9 channels for other plugins
  - Simpler code without array management
  - Better performance (1 channel check vs 10 per frame)
  - Follows architecture (one channel per plugin)

#### ðŸ”´ DISCOVERED: main.rs Pre-Registration Issue
- **Problem Found**: main.rs is ALSO registering channels before plugins initialize!
  - Lines 43-53: Registers "ui-framework" and "ui-framework-1" through "ui-framework-9"
  - Other plugins also being pre-registered (lines 50-117)
  - This causes duplicate registrations and wastes channels 2-10

- **Why It's Wrong**:
  - Channels are allocated sequentially (first-come, first-served)
  - NOT ranges (no "1-999 for systems" or "1000+ for plugins")
  - main.rs registers channels, then plugins try to register again
  - Results in: Channel 19 (UI), 20 (ui-framework), 2-10 (ui-framework-1 to 9), etc.

- **Fix Needed**:
  - main.rs should NOT pre-register ANY channels
  - Plugins should register their own channels in initialize()
  - OR plugins should get channel passed from main.rs registration

### Session 35 Accomplishments (Previous)

#### âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed Browser-Server Endianness Mismatch
- Fixed all DataView operations to use little-endian
- Browser can now properly request and receive channel manifest
- All control channel messages work correctly

### Next Steps for Session 38
1. **Test the system**:
   - Run playground-editor and verify plugins initialize
   - Check channel allocations in dashboard
   - Verify browser can connect and discover channels

2. **Complete dynamic channel implementation**:
   - Ensure browser uses discovered channels
   - Remove any remaining hardcoded channel references
   - Test channel discovery protocol

3. **Fix remaining warnings**:
   - Clean up unused imports
   - Fix unused variables
