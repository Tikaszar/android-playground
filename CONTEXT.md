# CONTEXT.md - Session Continuity

This file captures the current development session context for seamless continuation in future sessions.

## Current Session

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Focus**: ECS System Design and Architecture Planning
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS - Designing two-layer ECS system

## Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Focus**: WebSocket Architecture Documentation & Design Clarification
**Completed**: Full architectural documentation update removing WebRTC, establishing 4-layer system

## Session Achievements

### ‚úÖ Established 4-Layer Architecture

Successfully documented and clarified the complete engine architecture:

1. **Apps Layer** (Top)
   - Complete products (games, IDEs)
   - Manage and coordinate collections of plugins
   - Examples: playground-editor, idle-mmo-rpg

2. **Plugins Layer**
   - Reusable feature modules
   - Use Systems APIs ONLY (never Core directly)
   - Examples: inventory, combat, chat, editor-core
   - Exception: May implement custom Systems internally

3. **Systems Layer**
   - Engine components
   - Use Core APIs ONLY
   - Provide: ui, networking, rendering, physics, logic
   - Register channels 1-999 with core/server

4. **Core Layer** (Foundation)
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Provides: types, server, client, plugin, android
   - WebSocket multiplexer and channel management

### ‚úÖ WebSocket-Only Networking Design

Established complete WebSocket architecture (NO WebRTC):

1. **Binary Protocol**
   - Custom packet structure with channel routing
   - Frame-based batching (configurable, default 60fps)
   - Priority queues per channel (5 levels)
   - Serialization using `bytes` crate

2. **Channel System**
   - Channel 0: Control (registration, discovery)
   - Channels 1-999: Systems
   - Channels 1000+: Plugins/Apps
   - Dynamic runtime registration
   - KV store for discovery

3. **Authentication**
   - Passkey with 1Password integration
   - Google OAuth for external access
   - Server-side 1Password API primary

4. **WASM Compilation Strategies**
   - Separate: Each System, Plugin, App as .wasm
   - Hybrid: Each System and App as .wasm
   - Unified: Complete App as single .wasm

## Technical Design Decisions

### Architectural Rules Established

1. **Strict Layer Separation**
   - Apps ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Systems ‚Üí Core
   - Plugins NEVER use Core directly
   - Systems NEVER depend on other Systems
   - All networking through core/server

2. **Server Authority**
   - Browser is purely a view
   - All logic/state on server
   - No client-side decision making

3. **Communication Flow**
   - Plugin ‚Üí System ‚Üí core/server ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí core/client ‚Üí System ‚Üí Plugin
   - Frame-based batching always (no immediate sends)
   - Binary protocol for efficiency

### Current Implementation Status

**core/server**: ‚úÖ Full WebSocket multiplexer with binary protocol, channel system, and frame batching
**core/client**: ‚úÖ WASM module created with channel management and WebSocket connection
**systems/networking**: Skeleton only, needs full implementation
**systems/ui**: No WebSocket code yet - waiting for systems integration

## Documentation Updates

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md`: Complete rewrite with 4-layer architecture and WebSocket design
- `README.md`: Updated to reflect current architecture (private project)

### Key Changes

## Current Session - ECS Implementation

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Focus**: Two-layer ECS Architecture Implementation
**Status**: ‚úÖ BOTH core/ecs AND systems/logic COMPLETED

### ECS Design Decisions

After extensive discussion with the user, the following design decisions were made:

#### Two-Layer Architecture
1. **core/ecs**: Minimal ECS primitives for Systems to use internally
2. **systems/logic**: Full-featured game ECS for Plugins and Apps

#### Key Requirements Specified by User

**Core Architecture**:
- Generational IDs (reliable, safe, no crashes)
- Systems implement their own storage strategies
- Runtime component registration for hot-loading
- MUST be async and multithreaded from the core
- Soft-fail philosophy - graceful error handling

**API Design**:
- Builder pattern for queries
- Events as components (unified ECS approach)
- Batch operations ONLY (no single-entity APIs)
- Query caching with automatic invalidation

**Memory Management**:
- Global component pool with incremental growth
- Incremental per-frame garbage collection
- Memory warnings based on growth rate analysis
- Component pools to prevent memory exhaustion

**Networking**:
- Built-in NetworkedComponent trait
- Sync on dirty, batched per frame
- Binary serialization using `bytes` crate
- User-specified networking flow via Systems

**Hot-Reload**:
- Custom migration functions supported
- Automatic migration in dev/debug mode
- Strict version checking in release mode
- Stateless systems (state in Plugins/Apps only)

**System Dependencies**:
- Type-based: `depends_on<PhysicsSystem>`
- Retry logic: 3 attempts then halt
- Safe mode for disabling failing systems

### Implementation Plan

1. Create core/ecs with async World and entity management
2. Implement component storage traits and registration
3. Add binary serialization with bytes
4. Create systems/logic with hybrid archetype storage
5. Implement builder queries with caching
6. Add NetworkedComponent and dirty tracking
7. Implement incremental GC system
8. Create system scheduler with dependencies
9. Add memory monitoring and warnings
10. Implement hot-reload migration system

### Implementation Completed - core/ecs

‚úÖ **Core/ECS Features Implemented:**
- Generational entity IDs with recycling for safety
- Async/await throughout with tokio runtime
- Component storage with Dense and Sparse options
- Runtime component registration with type erasure
- Binary serialization using bytes crate
- Incremental garbage collection (2ms frame budget)
- Memory monitoring with growth rate analysis
- Builder pattern queries with caching support
- Dirty tracking for networked components
- Global component pool with configurable limits
- Batch-only API for all operations
- **NO unsafe code** - completely safe Rust
- **NO std::any::Any** - avoiding runtime type casting
- Soft-fail error handling with EcsResult everywhere

### Code Quality Principles Enforced

1. **No Unsafe Code**: The entire ECS is implemented without a single `unsafe` block
2. **No Any Trait**: Avoided std::any::Any for type erasure, using serialization instead
3. **Batch-Only API**: All operations work on batches, no single-entity methods
4. **Async Everything**: Full async/await support for concurrent operations
5. **Clean Module Structure**: lib.rs and mod.rs files only contain exports

### Systems/Logic Implementation Completed

‚úÖ **Full-Featured ECS Layer Implemented:**
- **Hybrid Storage**: Combined archetype (for iteration) and sparse (for random access)
- **Archetype Graph**: Fast component add/remove with cached transitions
- **System Scheduler**: Parallel execution with dependency resolution
- **NetworkedComponent Trait**: Automatic replication with dirty tracking
- **Event System**: Events as components with priority queues
- **Builder Queries**: Type-safe queries with caching support
- **Fixed/Adaptive Schedulers**: Multiple scheduling strategies
- **World Facade**: Clean API for Plugins and Apps
- **Batch-Only Operations**: All operations work on collections
- **Safe Mode**: Systems auto-disable after repeated failures

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Entity Management**: Generational IDs with safe recycling
2. **Component Registry**: Runtime registration with migration support
3. **Query Cache**: Frequently used queries are cached
4. **Dirty Tracking**: Automatic tracking for networked components
5. **System Dependencies**: Type-based dependency declaration
6. **Stage-Based Execution**: PreUpdate, Update, PostUpdate, etc.
7. **Resource Management**: Global resources with type safety
8. **Performance Metrics**: Frame timing and system profiling

### Next Integration Tasks:
1. **Wire up systems/networking** with core/server channels
2. **Update systems/ui** to use WebSocket infrastructure  
3. **Add reconnection logic** to core/client
4. **Implement LSP client** for rust-analyzer

### Session Handoff

Both Core/ecs and Systems/logic are fully implemented and compile successfully. The two-layer ECS architecture is complete with:

**Core/ECS Layer:**
- Safe, async, batch-only operations
- No unsafe code or Any usage
- Complete memory management and GC
- Foundation for Systems' internal use

**Systems/Logic Layer:**
- Full-featured game ECS for Plugins/Apps
