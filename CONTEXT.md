# CONTEXT.md - Session Continuity

This file captures the current development session context for seamless continuation in future sessions.

## Current Session

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Focus**: ECS System Design and Architecture Planning
**Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Designing two-layer ECS system

## Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Focus**: WebSocket Architecture Documentation & Design Clarification
**Completed**: Full architectural documentation update removing WebRTC, establishing 4-layer system

## Session Achievements

### ✅ Established 4-Layer Architecture

Successfully documented and clarified the complete engine architecture:

1. **Apps Layer** (Top)
   - Complete products (games, IDEs)
   - Manage and coordinate collections of plugins
   - Examples: playground-editor, idle-mmo-rpg

2. **Plugins Layer**
   - Reusable feature modules
   - Use Systems APIs ONLY (never Core directly)
   - Examples: inventory, combat, chat, editor-core
   - Exception: May implement custom Systems internally

3. **Systems Layer**
   - Engine components
   - Use Core APIs ONLY
   - Provide: ui, networking, rendering, physics, logic
   - Register channels 1-999 with core/server

4. **Core Layer** (Foundation)
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Provides: types, server, client, plugin, android
   - WebSocket multiplexer and channel management

### ✅ WebSocket-Only Networking Design

Established complete WebSocket architecture (NO WebRTC):

1. **Binary Protocol**
   - Custom packet structure with channel routing
   - Frame-based batching (configurable, default 60fps)
   - Priority queues per channel (5 levels)
   - Serialization using `bytes` crate

2. **Channel System**
   - Channel 0: Control (registration, discovery)
   - Channels 1-999: Systems
   - Channels 1000+: Plugins/Apps
   - Dynamic runtime registration
   - KV store for discovery

3. **Authentication**
   - Passkey with 1Password integration
   - Google OAuth for external access
   - Server-side 1Password API primary

4. **WASM Compilation Strategies**
   - Separate: Each System, Plugin, App as .wasm
   - Hybrid: Each System and App as .wasm
   - Unified: Complete App as single .wasm

## Technical Design Decisions

### Architectural Rules Established

1. **Strict Layer Separation**
   - Apps → Plugins → Systems → Core
   - Plugins NEVER use Core directly
   - Systems NEVER depend on other Systems
   - All networking through core/server

2. **Server Authority**
   - Browser is purely a view
   - All logic/state on server
   - No client-side decision making

3. **Communication Flow**
   - Plugin → System → core/server → WebSocket → core/client → System → Plugin
   - Frame-based batching always (no immediate sends)
   - Binary protocol for efficiency

### Current Implementation Status

**core/server**: ✅ Full WebSocket multiplexer with binary protocol, channel system, and frame batching
**core/client**: ✅ WASM module created with channel management and WebSocket connection
**systems/networking**: Skeleton only, needs full implementation
**systems/ui**: No WebSocket code yet - waiting for systems integration

## Documentation Updates

### Files Modified
- `CLAUDE.md`: Complete rewrite with 4-layer architecture and WebSocket design
- `README.md`: Updated to reflect current architecture (private project)

### Key Changes
- Removed ALL WebRTC references

## Next Session Starting Points

### Immediate Implementation Tasks

1. **core/server WebSocket Implementation**
   - Add tokio-tungstenite for WebSocket support
   - Implement channel registration system
   - Create packet routing/multiplexing
   - Add frame-based batching
   - Implement binary serialization

2. **core/client WASM Module**
   - Create new crate for browser client
   - Mirror server channel architecture
   - Implement reconnection logic
   - Add binary message handling

3. **Channel 0 Control Protocol**
   - Registration messages
   - Channel allocation
   - Discovery/query system
   - Error handling

4. **Systems Registration**
   - Update systems/ui to use core/server
   - Update systems/networking implementation
   - Remove direct WebSocket usage from systems

### Architecture Priorities

1. Get basic WebSocket working in core/server
2. Create minimal core/client for testing
3. Implement channel registration
4. Add packet serialization
5. Test with systems/ui terminal

## Important Notes

1. **Local-only focus**: This project runs entirely on Android device
2. **No WebRTC**: All networking is WebSocket-based
3. **Binary protocol**: Using bytes crate for efficiency
4. **Frame batching**: Never send packets immediately
5. **Dynamic channels**: Runtime registration, not compile-time

## Git Status

- Branch: main
- Last commit: "docs: Update architecture to WebSocket-only networking with 4-layer system"
- Documentation fully updated
- Implementation needs to follow

## Session Achievements - WebSocket Implementation

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Server WebSocket (COMPLETED)

2. ✅ Added WebSocket dependencies (tokio-tungstenite, bytes, dashmap, futures-util)
3. ✅ Created channel manager with registration system
4. ✅ Implemented binary packet protocol with serialization
5. ✅ Added WebSocket upgrade handler to existing Axum server
6. ✅ Built frame-based batching system (60fps default)

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Client WASM (COMPLETED)

    channel_id: u16,
    packet_type: u16,
    priority: u8,
    payload_size: u32,
    payload: Vec<u8>,
}
```

**Dependencies to Add**:

## Session Handoff

The WebSocket multiplexer is fully implemented and functional. Both core/server and core/client are complete with:
- Binary packet protocol with proper serialization
- Channel system (0: control, 1-999: systems, 1000+: plugins)
- Frame-based batching at 60fps
- Priority queues (5 levels)
- Control message handling for registration and discovery

**Next session should focus on:**
1. Integrating systems/networking with the new WebSocket infrastructure
2. Updating systems/ui to use core/server for all WebSocket needs
3. Implementing reconnection logic in core/client
4. Adding authentication (Passkey/1Password)
5. Performance testing and optimization

The architecture is proven and working. Android/Termux compatibility confirmed.

## Current Session - ECS System Design

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Focus**: Two-layer ECS Architecture Design
**Status**: Design phase completed, ready for implementation

### ECS Design Decisions

After extensive discussion with the user, the following design decisions were made:

#### Two-Layer Architecture
1. **core/ecs**: Minimal ECS primitives for Systems to use internally
2. **systems/logic**: Full-featured game ECS for Plugins and Apps

#### Key Requirements Specified by User

**Core Architecture**:
- Generational IDs (reliable, safe, no crashes)
- Systems implement their own storage strategies
- Runtime component registration for hot-loading
- MUST be async and multithreaded from the core
- Soft-fail philosophy - graceful error handling

**API Design**:
- Builder pattern for queries
- Events as components (unified ECS approach)
- Batch operations ONLY (no single-entity APIs)
- Query caching with automatic invalidation

**Memory Management**:
- Global component pool with incremental growth
- Incremental per-frame garbage collection
- Memory warnings based on growth rate analysis
- Component pools to prevent memory exhaustion

**Networking**:
- Built-in NetworkedComponent trait
- Sync on dirty, batched per frame
- Binary serialization using `bytes` crate
- User-specified networking flow via Systems

**Hot-Reload**:
- Custom migration functions supported
- Automatic migration in dev/debug mode
- Strict version checking in release mode
- Stateless systems (state in Plugins/Apps only)

**System Dependencies**:
- Type-based: `depends_on<PhysicsSystem>`
- Retry logic: 3 attempts then halt
- Safe mode for disabling failing systems

### Implementation Plan

1. Create core/ecs with async World and entity management
2. Implement component storage traits and registration
3. Add binary serialization with bytes
4. Create systems/logic with hybrid archetype storage
5. Implement builder queries with caching
6. Add NetworkedComponent and dirty tracking
7. Implement incremental GC system
8. Create system scheduler with dependencies
9. Add memory monitoring and warnings
10. Implement hot-reload migration system

### Next Steps

Begin implementation of core/ecs starting with:
- Cargo.toml with tokio, bytes, async-trait
- Entity ID generation with generations
- Component storage traits
- Async World structure
- Binary serialization
