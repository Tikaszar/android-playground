# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-20

### Current Status
**DASHBOARD INTEGRATED** ✅ - Unified dashboard system owned by core/server

### What Was Done This Session
- **Dashboard Unification**: 
  - Removed duplicate LoggingSystem from systems layer
  - Dashboard now owned by core/server (WebSocketState)
  - NetworkingSystem wraps/accesses server's dashboard
  - SystemsManager gets dashboard via NetworkingSystem
  - Dashboard enabled by default for playground-editor app
  
- **Architecture Fixes**:
  - Proper layer separation maintained (Systems can use Core)
  - Server creates and owns dashboard
  - Dashboard render loop starts with server
  - No environment variables needed - dashboard is default

- **Known Issues**:
  - Dashboard may not render properly - needs debugging
  - Check if "Dashboard: Starting render loop" appears in stderr

### Architecture Now Correct
```
Apps (playground-editor)
  ↓ creates systems/logic World
  ↓ creates SystemsManager 
  ↓ SystemsManager initializes all systems
  ↓ NetworkingSystem starts core/server internally
  ↓ Apps load Plugins and register as Systems
  ↓ Plugins only access Systems through systems/logic
```

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Builds and runs successfully!
```

### Next Steps
1. Test the running application
2. Verify MCP integration works
3. Test browser connection at http://localhost:8080/playground-editor/
4. Begin implementing actual functionality

### Key Learnings This Session
1. **Plugins ARE Systems** - No separate Plugin concept needed
2. **Only tokio::sync::RwLock allowed** - parking_lot causes Send issues across await
3. **Async propagates deeply** - One async function can require 100+ others to become async
4. **Automation is key** - Scripts for batch fixes saved hours of manual work
