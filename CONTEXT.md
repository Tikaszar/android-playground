# CONTEXT.md - Current Session Context

## Active Session - 2025-08-20

### Current Status
**BUILD FIXED** ✅ - playground-editor IDE compiles and runs successfully!

### What Was Done This Session (Afternoon - Build Fixes)
- **Fixed Compilation Errors**:
  - Resolved duplicate `create_element` function in systems/ui
  - Fixed main.rs imports - now uses library crate instead of redeclaring modules
  - Commented out idle-mmo-rpg and game plugins from workspace
  - Project now builds successfully!

- **Focused on IDE Only**:
  - Deferred game design for later sessions
  - playground-editor is the primary focus
  - 8 IDE plugins ready for implementation
  - MCP integration confirmed working

### What Was Done This Session (Earlier)
- **Dashboard Unification**: 
  - Removed duplicate LoggingSystem from systems layer
  - Dashboard now owned by core/server (WebSocketState)
  - NetworkingSystem wraps/accesses server's dashboard
  - SystemsManager gets dashboard via NetworkingSystem
  - Dashboard enabled by default for playground-editor app
  
- **Architecture Fixes**:
  - Proper layer separation maintained (Systems can use Core)
  - Server creates and owns dashboard
  - Dashboard render loop starts with server
  - No environment variables needed - dashboard is default

### Current Session Work - UI Framework
- **Architecture Understanding Corrected**:
  - Apps (playground-editor) are THE AUTHORITY - control flow and state
  - Plugins (ui-framework) provide reusable features using Systems
  - UI Framework Plugin customizes generic systems/ui for Discord-style interface
  - Systems provide generic capabilities, Plugins customize them

- **Issues Identified**:
  1. **Black Screen**: UI Framework exists but doesn't actually render anything
  2. **Client Tracking**: Dashboard keeps disconnected clients (just changes status)
  3. **No Render Pipeline**: Missing render command generation and WebGL execution

- **Implementation Plan Created**:
  - Fix client tracking in Dashboard (temp vs verified clients)
  - Complete UiSystem render() method to generate commands
  - UI Framework Plugin creates Discord UI via UiSystem
  - Browser implements WebGL rendering of commands
  - Maintain proper architecture (no violations)

### Architecture Now Correct
```
Apps (playground-editor)
  ↓ creates systems/logic World
  ↓ creates SystemsManager 
  ↓ SystemsManager initializes all systems
  ↓ NetworkingSystem starts core/server internally
  ↓ Apps load Plugins and register as Systems
  ↓ Plugins only access Systems through systems/logic
```

### Build Command
```bash
cargo run -p playground-apps-editor  # Builds and runs successfully!
```

### Next Steps
1. Implement UI rendering pipeline (fix black screen)
2. Fix client tracking in Dashboard
3. Complete Discord-style UI in browser
4. Test IDE plugin functionality
5. Design idle-mmo-rpg game mechanics (future session)

### Key Learnings This Session
1. **Plugins ARE Systems** - No separate Plugin concept needed
2. **Only tokio::sync::RwLock allowed** - parking_lot causes Send issues across await
3. **Async propagates deeply** - One async function can require 100+ others to become async
4. **Automation is key** - Scripts for batch fixes saved hours of manual work
