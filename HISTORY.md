   - Test tools execute directly in MCP server
   - Tools return proper JSON-RPC responses

2. **Dynamic MCP Tool Registration System**
   - Added McpTool struct to WebSocketState with tool registry
   - Implemented register_mcp_tool() in WebSocketState
   - Added MCP tool registration API in systems/networking
