# HISTORY.md - Development Session History

This file tracks the detailed history of development sessions, including achievements, bug fixes, and implementation progress.

## Session: 2025-08-23 - Partial Deadlock Resolution (Session 14)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed Multiple Lock-Holding Issues**
   - Changed World storages from Box<dyn ComponentStorage> to Arc<dyn ComponentStorage>
   - Refactored 10+ World methods to clone Arc references instead of holding locks
   - Fixed get_dirty_entities, clear_dirty, spawn_batch, despawn_immediate
   - Updated Query trait to work with Arc instead of Box

2. **Fixed Log Method Deadlocks**
   - UiSystem::log was holding networking lock while calling dashboard.log
   - Refactored to get dashboard reference, drop lock, then log
   - Applied same pattern to initialize_client_renderer

3. **Improved Debugging**
   - Added detailed logging to track component operations
   - Discovered elements have default style components on creation
   - Identified hang occurs in storage.remove() for existing components

### Remaining Issue
- storage.remove() hangs when removing existing style component
- System no longer completely deadlocks - other operations continue
- Need to investigate SparseStorage::remove implementation

## Session: 2025-08-23 - ECS Deadlock Fix (Session 13)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed Critical ECS Deadlock**
   - Identified root cause: nested Shared<> (Arc<RwLock>) in World structure
   - UiSystem had `world: Shared<World>` but World already has internal Shared<> fields
   - Holding outer lock while calling async methods that acquire inner locks = deadlock
   - Solution: Changed UiSystem to use `world: Arc<World>` instead
   - World's methods handle their own internal locking

2. **Systematic Refactoring**
   - Updated UiSystem struct field from `Shared<World>` to `Arc<World>`
   - Fixed all World method calls to work directly on Arc<World>
   - Updated InputManager to accept `&Arc<World>` instead of `&Shared<World>`
   - Fixed LayoutEngine and all layout modules (flexbox, absolute, docking)
   - Removed all `.read().await` and `.write().await` calls on World
   - Fixed ~50+ locations across multiple files

### Key Learning
**Never wrap a struct in Shared<> if it already has internal Shared<> fields**
- Creates nested locking situations
- Async executors can't handle nested locks well
- Causes deadlocks when holding outer lock across await points
- Solution: Let the struct handle its own internal locking

## Session: 2025-08-22 - Mobile Discord UI Implementation (Session 10)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Created core/ui Package**
   - Base UI traits (UiElement, UiContainer, UiRenderer)
   - Mobile-first types with touch events and gestures
   - Pure contracts, no implementation
   - Support for safe areas and orientation changes

2. **Implemented UiRenderer in systems/ui**
   - UiSystem now implements core/ui::UiRenderer trait
   - Fixed set_element_text to actually update components
   - Added mobile orientation handling
   - Proper mapping between core and internal types

3. **Enhanced UiInterface for Mobile**
   - Added create_mobile_discord_layout()
   - Mobile channel drawer (off-screen, swipe to show)
   - Touch-friendly sizing (40px min height)
   - add_message() for Discord-style messages

4. **Updated UI Framework Plugin**
   - Mobile Discord layout with hamburger menu
   - Channel drawer navigation
   - Touch-optimized buttons and text
   - Proper Discord mobile colors

5. **Fixed Plugin Initialization Issue**
   - Plugin's initialize() wasn't being called
   - Fixed in main.rs to call initialize before registration
   - UI elements now being created properly

### Architecture Maintained
- Strict layering: Apps → Plugins → Systems → Core
- Plugins cannot import core/* packages
- Dual ECS: core/ecs for systems, systems/logic for plugins
- Mobile-first design throughout

## Session: 2025-08-22 - Complete WebGL Rendering Fix (Session 9)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed WebGL DrawQuad Rendering**
   - Added shader program activation in executeCommandBatch()
   - Fixed projection matrix setup and uniform binding
   - DrawQuad now renders red rectangle at (100, 100)
   - Both Clear and DrawQuad commands working perfectly

2. **Implemented Server-Controlled Renderer Initialization**
   - Added new message types: RendererInit, LoadShader, LoadTexture, UnloadResource
   - Server sends default shaders on client connect
   - NO std::any::Any - uses enums and bincode serialization
   - Shaders compiled on client from server-provided source

3. **Added Resource Caching System**
   - Created ResourceCache class with LRU eviction
   - 100MB memory limit with automatic cleanup
   - Caches shaders and textures for reconnection
   - Preserves resources across disconnect/reconnect

4. **Implemented Clean Shutdown Protocol**
   - RendererShutdown message for proper disposal
   - WebGL resource cleanup (VAOs, buffers, shaders)
   - No memory leaks on disconnect
   - Proper lifecycle management

### Key Architecture Compliance
- **NO unsafe code** - maintained throughout
- **NO std::any::Any** - used enums and serialization
- **Shared<T> pattern** - for all concurrency
- **Files under 1000 lines** - largest is 828 lines
- **Complete implementations** - no TODOs

## Session: 2025-08-21 - UI Framework Architecture Fix (Session 4)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed Plugin Architecture Violations**
   - Plugins were using core/ecs directly - VIOLATION!
   - Created UiInterface in systems/logic for proper abstraction
   - Plugins now use systems/logic World and ECS correctly
   - Clean separation between plugin state and UI internals

2. **Created Public UI API**
   - Added systems/ui/src/types.rs with public types
   - ElementStyle, ElementBounds, DiscordLayout, etc.
   - Added public methods to UiSystem for plugins
   - set_element_style(), set_element_bounds(), create_element_with_id()

3. **Fixed UI Framework Plugin**
   - Removed playground-core-ecs dependency entirely
   - Updated to use UiInterface from systems/logic
   - Uses high-level create_discord_layout() method
   - Successfully compiles with zero errors

4. **Established Render Pipeline Architecture**
   - Created RenderingInterface in systems/logic
   - SystemsManager exposes ui_interface() and rendering_interface()
   - Clear path: Plugin → UiInterface → UiSystem → Channel 10 → Browser WebGL

### Key Architecture Clarification
- **Plugins MUST use systems/logic ECS** - never core/ecs
- **UiSystem uses core/ecs internally** - this is private
- **Clean API boundaries** - no mixing of ECS layers

## Session: 2025-08-21 - Core Compilation Fixes (Session 3)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed All Core/Systems Compilation Errors**
   - Removed last DashMap usage from systems/networking
   - Fixed SerializationError → SerializationFailed throughout
   - Added missing dependencies (playground-core-rendering to systems/logic)
   - Fixed all async/await issues

2. **Redesigned ECS Component Access Pattern**
   - Removed broken get_component_mut returning Shared<ComponentBox>
   - Added update_component<T> with closure-based updates
   - Fixed all UI layout systems to use new pattern
   - No more field access errors on trait objects

3. **Fixed UI System Issues**
   - Theme variable scoping corrected
   - ElementBounds type references fixed
   - Input manager updated for new component access
   - All get_component_mut calls replaced with update_component

### Key Design Decision
- **Component Updates via Closures**: Instead of returning mutable references to components (impossible with our no-Any constraint), we use update_component with closures that modify the component in place. This maintains type safety without runtime casting.

## Session: 2025-08-21 - WebGL Renderer Implementation (Morning)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed core/ecs Compilation Errors**
   - Fixed all remaining Shared<T> migration issues
   - Corrected HashMap iteration patterns (tuples not entries)
   - Fixed async/await propagation throughout
   - Removed last dashmap references from Cargo.toml files

2. **Created systems/webgl Package**

   - Vertex and index buffer batching system
   - Support for all RenderCommand types
   - Transform matrix and clip rect stacks
   - Shader program and texture management
   - 400+ lines of renderer implementation

3. **Fixed core/rendering Exports**
   - Added Viewport export
   - Added RendererCapabilities export  
   - Fixed trait exports for CommandEncoder

## Session: 2025-08-21 - UI Restructuring & ECS Mutable Access (Afternoon)

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed UI Directory Structure Violation**
   - Previous session collapsed complex directories into monolithic files
   - Violated 1000-line rule with single large files
   - Restructured all UI modules into proper directories:
     - components/ (element, layout, style, input, text)
     - input/ (event, manager, gestures)
     - layout/ (engine, flexbox, absolute, docking)
     - rendering/ (converter, element_renderer)
     - terminal/ (manager, emulator)
     - mobile/ (features, floating_toolbar)
     - theme/ (types, colors, manager)

2. **Fixed core/ecs for Mutable Component Access**
   - Changed storage from ComponentBox to Shared<ComponentBox>
   - Added get_component_mut method to World
   - Added get_raw_mut to ComponentStorage trait
   - Updated both SparseStorage and DenseStorage
   - Added ComponentInUse error for removal conflicts
   - NO unsafe code used (maintained architecture rule)

3. **Updated Component Implementations**
   - Fixed all UI components to use async trait methods
   - Changed from Result<Vec<u8>, EcsError> to EcsResult<Bytes>
   - Using TypeId::of::<Self>() for component IDs
   - Added async_trait to all component implementations

### Issues Discovered
- get_component_mut returns Shared<ComponentBox> not typed components
- UI system expects direct field access on components
- Need proper type casting mechanism without std::any::Any

### Next Steps
- Fix typed component access from get_component_mut
- Update UI system to use new mutable access pattern
- Complete compilation of playground-editor

## Session: 2025-08-20 (Late Evening) - Major Architecture Fix: Shared<T> Pattern

### Critical Architecture Violation Fixed
1. **Created Shared<T> Type Alias**
   - New file: core/types/src/shared.rs
   - `type Shared<T> = Arc<RwLock<T>>` using tokio::sync::RwLock
   - Helper function `shared()` for construction
   - Single source of truth for all concurrent access

2. **Replaced ALL parking_lot Usage**
   - core/ecs: world.rs, component.rs, storage.rs, entity.rs, query.rs
   - All parking_lot::RwLock → tokio::sync::RwLock via Shared<T>
   - All parking_lot::Mutex → tokio::sync::Mutex
   - Functions made async where needed

3. **Replaced ALL DashMap Usage**  
   - All DashMap<K, V> → Shared<HashMap<K, V>>
   - Fixed in core/ecs and core/server
   - Proper async access patterns with .read().await and .write().await

4. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Plugins/Apps use `playground_systems_logic::{Shared, shared}`
   - Core/Systems use `playground_core_types::{Shared, shared}`
   - Removed parking_lot and dashmap from all Cargo.toml files
   - Complete compliance with architecture rules

### Why This Matters
- parking_lot::RwLock guards don't implement Send trait
- This caused "cannot be sent between threads safely" errors
- DashMap adds complexity and isn't needed with proper async patterns
- Shared<T> provides clean, consistent API throughout codebase

## Session: 2025-08-20 (Evening) - Rendering Architecture Implementation

### Created core/rendering Package
1. **Base Rendering Contracts**
   - Created new core/rendering package with base traits
   - Renderer trait for platform-agnostic rendering
   - RenderTarget trait for render destinations
   - CommandEncoder trait for command buffering
   
2. **Render Commands**
   - RenderCommand enum with all drawing operations
   - Clear, DrawQuad, DrawText, DrawImage, DrawLine, DrawCircle
   - SetClipRect, Transform operations, State push/pop
   - RenderCommandBatch for efficient frame batching
   
3. **Architecture Rules Clarified**
   - NO unsafe, NO std::any::Any, NO super keywords
   - Files must be under 1000 lines
   - lib.rs/mod.rs are exports only
   - Systems use core/ecs internally
   - Plugins ARE Systems in systems/logic

### Next Session Plans
- Update systems/rendering to use core/rendering traits
- Add render command generation to UiSystem
- Implement Discord UI in UI Framework Plugin
- Switch browser from Canvas2D to WebGL

## Session: 2025-08-20 (Afternoon) - Dashboard Unification, UI Planning & Build Fixes

### Afternoon: Build Fixes & Project Focus
1. **Fixed Compilation Errors**
   - Duplicate `create_element` function in systems/ui/system.rs (lines 168 and 279)
   - Fixed by removing second duplicate function body
   - core/server/src/main.rs was redeclaring modules instead of using library
   - Changed to import from playground_core_server library crate

2. **Focused Project Scope**
   - Commented out idle-mmo-rpg app from workspace
   - Commented out 10 game plugins (inventory, combat, chat, etc.)
   - Focus now entirely on playground-editor IDE
   - Game design deferred to future sessions

3. **Build Status**
   - playground-editor now builds successfully!
   - Only warnings remain (unused variables, etc.)
   - MCP integration confirmed working
   - Ready for UI implementation

### Morning: Dashboard Unification
1. **Unified Dashboard System**
   - Removed LoggingSystem from systems layer completely
   - Dashboard now owned by core/server where it belongs
   - NetworkingSystem creates dashboard and passes to WebSocketState
   - SystemsManager accesses dashboard through NetworkingSystem
   - Proper architecture: Server owns, Systems wrap/access

2. **Default Dashboard Mode**
   - No environment variables required
   - Dashboard enabled by default for playground-editor
   - Just run `cargo run -p playground-apps-editor`

3. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Systems can use Core (proper layering)
   - No violations of 4-layer architecture
   - Dashboard lifecycle managed by server

### Afternoon: UI Framework Investigation & Planning
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Discovered UI Framework Plugin exists but doesn't render anything
   - Browser shows black screen after WebSocket connection
   - Dashboard doesn't remove disconnected clients (only changes status)
   - No actual render command pipeline exists

2. **Architecture Understanding Refined**
   - **Apps are THE AUTHORITY** - playground-editor controls everything
   - **Plugins provide features** - ui-framework customizes generic systems
   - **Systems are generic** - ui, rendering, networking are engine capabilities
   - UI Framework should USE systems/ui, not implement its own rendering

3. **Rendering Architecture Clarified**
   - Browser uses WebGL/WebGPU for rendering (future: Vulkan)
   - Server sends render commands, NOT HTML/DOM
   - UiSystem generates render commands
   - NetworkingSystem transmits them
   - Browser executes commands on canvas

4. **Comprehensive Implementation Plan Created**
   - Fix client tracking (temp vs verified lists)
   - Complete UiSystem render() method
   - UI Framework creates Discord UI via UiSystem
   - Browser implements WebGL command execution
   - Maintain clean architecture

### Issues & Debugging
- Dashboard render loop may not display output
- Black screen in browser needs render pipeline
- Client list grows indefinitely (never removes disconnected)

## Session: 2025-08-19 - Major Architecture Refactoring, Async Overhaul & Dashboard

### Evening: WebSocket Fixes & Terminal Dashboard
1. **Fixed Browser WebSocket Connection**
   - Removed channel registration (browser is client, not system)
   - Fixed byte order mismatch (little-endian to big-endian)
   - Added 100ms delay to avoid race condition
   - Browser now connects cleanly without errors

2. **Terminal Dashboard Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive monitoring dashboard in core/server
   - Shows real-time client connections with status emojis
   - Displays server stats, MCP sessions, recent activity
   - File logging for verbose output (logs directory)
   - Dashboard updates every second
   - Replaces scrolling logs with organized display

3. **Dashboard Features**:
   - Client tracking (connected/idle/disconnected)
   - Message and byte counters per client
   - Recent activity log (last 10 entries)
   - MCP session monitoring
   - Color-coded log levels
   - Automatic log file creation with timestamps

## Session: 2025-08-19 - Major Architecture Refactoring & Async Overhaul

### Morning: Architecture Refactoring
1. **Plugin Architecture Completely Redesigned**
   - Removed core/plugin package entirely
   - Plugins now implement systems/logic::System trait
   - No separate Plugin trait - Plugins ARE Systems
   - Apps load plugins and register them as Systems in World
   - Fixed critical layering violation

2. **NetworkingSystem Improvements**
   - Now starts core/server internally via run_core_server()
   - Apps no longer need to know about core/server
   - Added axum, tower, tower-http dependencies to networking

3. **Dependency Version Fixes**
   - Fixed axum version mismatch (0.7 vs 0.8)
   - All packages now use workspace version (0.8)
   - Fixed tower-http version mismatch

### Afternoon: Massive Async/Await Refactoring
1. **RwLock Migration (CRITICAL FIX)**
   - Replaced ALL `parking_lot::RwLock` with `tokio::sync::RwLock`
   - Fixed Send trait issues - parking_lot guards aren't Send across await
   - This was causing compilation failures in tokio::spawn

2. **Async Function Propagation**
   - Made 100+ functions async in systems/logic
   - Created automation scripts:
     - `fix-rwlock-await.sh` - Added .await to all RwLock calls
     - `fix-async.py` - Made functions containing .await async
   - Fixed 69 initial async/await errors, then 35 more, then final 5

3. **Files Modified in systems/logic**:
   - scheduler.rs - All methods made async
   - system.rs - Executor methods async
   - world.rs - Most public APIs async
   - entity.rs - All CRUD operations async
   - storage.rs - All storage operations async
   - component.rs - Registry methods async
   - archetype.rs - Graph operations async
   - event.rs - Event system async
   - query.rs - Query execution async

### Key Learning: Async Propagation Pattern
When converting from sync to async RwLock:
1. Change `use parking_lot::RwLock` to `use tokio::sync::RwLock`
2. Add `.await` to all `.read()` and `.write()` calls
3. Make containing functions `async`
4. Propagate async up the call chain
5. Fix all callers to use `.await`

### Build Status Evolution
- Start: 1 error (Send trait in main.rs)
- After RwLock change: 69 errors
- After first script: 35 errors  
- After second script: 19 errors
- After manual fixes: 5 errors
- **Final: 0 errors - FULLY COMPILING!**

### Bug Fixes
- **Issue**: `*mut ()` cannot be sent between threads safely
  - **Root Cause**: parking_lot::RwLock guards don't implement Send
  - **Fix**: Use tokio::sync::RwLock throughout
- **Issue**: Hundreds of "await only in async" errors
  - **Fix**: Systematic async function conversion
- **Issue**: Manual fixes would take hours
  - **Fix**: Created automation scripts for batch changes

   - NO TURBOFISH anywhere in codebase

4. **Plugin Trait Fixes**
   - All plugins now use async trait methods
   - Fixed PluginContext → Context 
   - Added async-trait dependency to all plugins
   - Removed invalid id() method from plugins

- Removed FileTree, CodeEditor from systems/ui (moved to plugins)
- Removed ChatInterface from systems/ui (moved to chat-assistant)
- systems/ui now contains ONLY generic components

## Session: MCP Integration

### MCP Server Implementation
Successfully integrated MCP server into core/server:

**UI-Focused Tools Created**:
- `show_file` - Display file content in editor
- `update_editor` - Update current editor content  
- `show_terminal_output` - Display terminal output
- `update_file_tree` - Update file browser
- `show_diff` - Display diff view
- `show_error` - Show error messages
- `update_status_bar` - Update status
- `show_notification` - Display notifications
- `open_panel` - Open IDE panels
- `show_chat_message` - Display chat messages

**Deep Server Integration**:
- MCP is part of core/server (not separate process)
- Uses existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Leverages channel manager
- Uses frame batcher for efficient packet delivery
- Mounted at `/mcp` endpoints
