# HISTORY.md - Development Session History

This file tracks the detailed history of development sessions, including achievements, bug fixes, and implementation progress.

## Session: 2025-08-20 - Dashboard Unification, UI Planning & Build Fixes

### Afternoon: Build Fixes & Project Focus
1. **Fixed Compilation Errors**
   - Duplicate `create_element` function in systems/ui/system.rs (lines 168 and 279)
   - Fixed by removing second duplicate function body
   - core/server/src/main.rs was redeclaring modules instead of using library
   - Changed to import from playground_core_server library crate

2. **Focused Project Scope**
   - Commented out idle-mmo-rpg app from workspace
   - Commented out 10 game plugins (inventory, combat, chat, etc.)
   - Focus now entirely on playground-editor IDE
   - Game design deferred to future sessions

3. **Build Status**
   - playground-editor now builds successfully!
   - Only warnings remain (unused variables, etc.)
   - MCP integration confirmed working
   - Ready for UI implementation

### Morning: Dashboard Unification
1. **Unified Dashboard System**
   - Removed LoggingSystem from systems layer completely
   - Dashboard now owned by core/server where it belongs
   - NetworkingSystem creates dashboard and passes to WebSocketState
   - SystemsManager accesses dashboard through NetworkingSystem
   - Proper architecture: Server owns, Systems wrap/access

2. **Default Dashboard Mode**
   - No environment variables required
   - Dashboard enabled by default for playground-editor
   - Just run `cargo run -p playground-apps-editor`

3. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Systems can use Core (proper layering)
   - No violations of 4-layer architecture
   - Dashboard lifecycle managed by server

### Afternoon: UI Framework Investigation & Planning
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Discovered UI Framework Plugin exists but doesn't render anything
   - Browser shows black screen after WebSocket connection
   - Dashboard doesn't remove disconnected clients (only changes status)
   - No actual render command pipeline exists

2. **Architecture Understanding Refined**
   - **Apps are THE AUTHORITY** - playground-editor controls everything
   - **Plugins provide features** - ui-framework customizes generic systems
   - **Systems are generic** - ui, rendering, networking are engine capabilities
   - UI Framework should USE systems/ui, not implement its own rendering

3. **Rendering Architecture Clarified**
   - Browser uses WebGL/WebGPU for rendering (future: Vulkan)
   - Server sends render commands, NOT HTML/DOM
   - UiSystem generates render commands
   - NetworkingSystem transmits them
   - Browser executes commands on canvas

4. **Comprehensive Implementation Plan Created**
   - Fix client tracking (temp vs verified lists)
   - Complete UiSystem render() method
   - UI Framework creates Discord UI via UiSystem
   - Browser implements WebGL command execution
   - Maintain clean architecture

### Issues & Debugging
- Dashboard render loop may not display output
- Black screen in browser needs render pipeline
- Client list grows indefinitely (never removes disconnected)

## Session: 2025-08-19 - Major Architecture Refactoring, Async Overhaul & Dashboard

### Evening: WebSocket Fixes & Terminal Dashboard
1. **Fixed Browser WebSocket Connection**
   - Removed channel registration (browser is client, not system)
   - Fixed byte order mismatch (little-endian to big-endian)
   - Added 100ms delay to avoid race condition
   - Browser now connects cleanly without errors

2. **Terminal Dashboard Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive monitoring dashboard in core/server
   - Shows real-time client connections with status emojis
   - Displays server stats, MCP sessions, recent activity
   - File logging for verbose output (logs directory)
   - Dashboard updates every second
   - Replaces scrolling logs with organized display

3. **Dashboard Features**:
   - Client tracking (connected/idle/disconnected)
   - Message and byte counters per client
   - Recent activity log (last 10 entries)
   - MCP session monitoring
   - Color-coded log levels
   - Automatic log file creation with timestamps

## Session: 2025-08-19 - Major Architecture Refactoring & Async Overhaul

### Morning: Architecture Refactoring
1. **Plugin Architecture Completely Redesigned**
   - Removed core/plugin package entirely
   - Plugins now implement systems/logic::System trait
   - No separate Plugin trait - Plugins ARE Systems
   - Apps load plugins and register them as Systems in World
   - Fixed critical layering violation

2. **NetworkingSystem Improvements**
   - Now starts core/server internally via run_core_server()
   - Apps no longer need to know about core/server
   - Added axum, tower, tower-http dependencies to networking

3. **Dependency Version Fixes**
   - Fixed axum version mismatch (0.7 vs 0.8)
   - All packages now use workspace version (0.8)
   - Fixed tower-http version mismatch

### Afternoon: Massive Async/Await Refactoring
1. **RwLock Migration (CRITICAL FIX)**
   - Replaced ALL `parking_lot::RwLock` with `tokio::sync::RwLock`
   - Fixed Send trait issues - parking_lot guards aren't Send across await
   - This was causing compilation failures in tokio::spawn

2. **Async Function Propagation**
   - Made 100+ functions async in systems/logic
   - Created automation scripts:
     - `fix-rwlock-await.sh` - Added .await to all RwLock calls
     - `fix-async.py` - Made functions containing .await async
   - Fixed 69 initial async/await errors, then 35 more, then final 5

3. **Files Modified in systems/logic**:
   - scheduler.rs - All methods made async
   - system.rs - Executor methods async
   - world.rs - Most public APIs async
   - entity.rs - All CRUD operations async
   - storage.rs - All storage operations async
   - component.rs - Registry methods async
   - archetype.rs - Graph operations async
   - event.rs - Event system async
   - query.rs - Query execution async

### Key Learning: Async Propagation Pattern
When converting from sync to async RwLock:
1. Change `use parking_lot::RwLock` to `use tokio::sync::RwLock`
2. Add `.await` to all `.read()` and `.write()` calls
3. Make containing functions `async`
4. Propagate async up the call chain
5. Fix all callers to use `.await`

### Build Status Evolution
- Start: 1 error (Send trait in main.rs)
- After RwLock change: 69 errors
- After first script: 35 errors  
- After second script: 19 errors
- After manual fixes: 5 errors
- **Final: 0 errors - FULLY COMPILING!**

### Bug Fixes
- **Issue**: `*mut ()` cannot be sent between threads safely
  - **Root Cause**: parking_lot::RwLock guards don't implement Send
  - **Fix**: Use tokio::sync::RwLock throughout
- **Issue**: Hundreds of "await only in async" errors
  - **Fix**: Systematic async function conversion
- **Issue**: Manual fixes would take hours
  - **Fix**: Created automation scripts for batch changes

## Session: Package Standardization & Build Fixes
